===Studying MCF-10A morphogenesis in 3D cell culture===

====Imaging a fixed, large spheroid (&oslash; &asymp; 500 µm) on Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1====

* '''Sample preparation'''
  
We used a cell line expressing GFP-tagged histone 2B. The spheroid was embedded together with beads in 1.5 % agarose in a glass capillary (black label).

* '''Imaging'''
** 1 timepoint, 6 angles, dual-side illumination
** excitation: 488 nm
** detection: 20x ...

* '''Results'''
  
After approximately 2 h 6 min (2 h to set up the acquisition, 6 min to run it) we had a nice 36 GB data set. Post-processing in progress, images will follow...

====Outlook: Overnight time-lapse imaging of living, 4-days-old spheroids (&oslash; &asymp; 50 µm) on Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1====

* '''Sample preparation'''
  
H2B-GFP cells were additionally labelled with the live-dye SiR-tubulin ([http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n7/full/nmeth.2972.html Lukinavičius et al. 2014]). They were embedded as single cells in Matrigel and injected into chambers made of either 1 % Gelrite or 1.5 % agarose. We incubated the chambers, and for the past four days the cells have been proliferating and forming small spheroids.

=== Project 2: Brain reaction to the two-photon laser-induced ablation in the zebrafish larvae ===
====Purpose of the project====
Zebrafish have high regenerative potential of tissues including brain, retina and fin. In our lab I and many colleagues are interested in why they can restore injured brain after traumatic injury. I focus especially on the roles of immune cells, key players in inflammation, for the tissue recovery as previously we demonstrated that acute inflammation which emerges immediately after injury is an important positive regulator of regeneration.<br>
Considering highly dynamic property of the immune cells that are known to participate in the inflammation and longevity of the entire event, SPIM observation is the suitable way to study their behaviour. In this course I want to find the best configuration of 2-photon light sheet laser for making traumatic injury and live-image
neural behaviour during early acute inflammation.


====Material & Method====
1. The zebrafish larvae (3dpf) that express GFP-HuC (marker of neuron) are anesthetized with tricane (200µg/mL) and embedded into FEP tubes filled with 1.5% agarose containing tricane. (Fig.2-1-1)<br>
2. Tube  is mechanically attached to a metal-based sample holder and then applied for two-photon light sheet microscopy.<br>
3. By confining area of light sheet illumination of high-power 2P laser, we make well-targeted injury (Fig.2-1-2).<br>
*Laser power: <700mW<br>
*Wave length: 950 nm<br>
*Duration: <2 sec<br>

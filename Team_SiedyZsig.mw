===Studying MCF-10A morphogenesis in 3D cell culture===

====Imaging a fixed, large spheroid (&oslash; &asymp; 500 µm) on Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1====

* '''Sample preparation'''
  
We used a cell line expressing GFP-tagged histone 2B. The spheroid was embedded together with beads in 1.5 % agarose in a glass capillary (black label).

* '''Imaging'''
** 1 timepoint, 6 angles, dual-side illumination
** excitation: 488 nm
** detection: 20x ...

* '''Results'''
  
After approximately 2 h 6 min (2 h to set up the acquisition, 6 min to run it) we had a nice 36 GB data set. Post-processing in progress, images will follow...

====Outlook: Overnight time-lapse imaging of living, 4-days-old spheroids (&oslash; &asymp; 50 µm) on Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1====

* '''Sample preparation'''
  
H2B-GFP cells were additionally labelled with the live-dye SiR-tubulin ([http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n7/full/nmeth.2972.html Lukinavičius et al. 2014]). They were embedded as single cells in Matrigel and injected into chambers made of either 1 % Gelrite or 1.5 % agarose. We incubated the chambers, and for the past four days the cells have been proliferating and forming small spheroids.

====Sample Preparation and Laser Ablation====

[[File:sample_holder.png|200px|thumb]]
'''Sample used
*3 days post fertilization
*PTU treated: to inhibit pigmentation
*Expressing HuC-GFP or Ras-GFP: labeling neuron or cellular membrane, respectively
1. The zebrafish are anesthetized with tricane (200µg/mL) and embedded into FEP tubes (inner and outer diameters: 0.8mm and 1.6mm, respectively)filled with 0.1% agarose containing tricane.<br>
2. A tube was fixed to a metal-based sample holder with adhesive tape.<br>
3. To make the nearest access of the laser to the brain, the tube was rotated dorsal-side upright (see the scheme).<br>
4. By confining area of light sheet illumination with high-power two-photon laser, we succeeded to make well-targeted injury as shown on the right.<br>
'''Parameters for laser ablation<br>
*Laser power: <600mW
*Wave length: 920 nm
*Duration: <2 sec

=== from Z stack to θ stack===

====Initial question and approach====
Can we image the full periphery of an organism without generating a huge amount of data that require extensive post processing time to be reconstruct? One idea is to perform the imaging around the main axis of the body, like camembert slices (figure 1). To keep the time resolution high and the time to set up the experiment reasonable the acquisition of the stacks would need to require only the rotation motor and not the translation ones but that means that the main axis of the embryo must be align with the one of the rotation motor.

To align the capillary and the motor axis 3D printers would give us a precision lower than 10 µm and to center the embryo in the agarose tube my idea is to us hydrodynamic forces. Indeed the mounting of the embryo in the agarose happens at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow#cite_note-Kirby-2/ low Reynolds number] , therefore a Poiseuille flow is established in the capillary during the aspiration of the embryo, i.e. the speed of the fluid is maximal at the center of the canal and null on the side. In theory due to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics) hydrodynamic drag], for an embryo with high aspect ratio like drosophila one of the equilibrium position in this parabolic flow is at the center of the capillary with its long axis parallel to the flow. The idea is to temper the capillary containing the agarose and the sample while the flow is still running to freeze the sample in position.

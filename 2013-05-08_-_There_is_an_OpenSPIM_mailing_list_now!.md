The recommended way to contact the developers of the OpenSPIM platform
has been long advertised as mailing to the address
openspim@openspim.org. This continues to be the case.

However, OpenSPIM was always intended to be an open platform, a project
you can be part of when <u>you</u> decide to join it, not when somebody
"let's you in".

For this reason, openspim@openspim.org is now a mailing list to which
you can subscribe yourself\! Just direct your browser to [this
page](http://openspim.org/mailman/listinfo/openspim) and subscribe
yourself\!

Integral part of SPIM imaging is data processing sometimes referred to as '''SPIMage processing'''. The OpenSPIM project relies on tight integration with [http://fiji.sc Fiji] where most of the algorithms for SPIMage processing have been implemented in the past.

We have assembled [[Operation#Data_processing|'''extensive tutorials''']] that will walk you through all the steps required to put multi-view SPIM data together.

* We start by defining [[Pre-requisites|'''System requirements''']] and downloading [[Raw_data|'''sample OpenSPIM data]],
* followed by optional [[Pre-processing|'''pre-processing steps''']].
* [[Registration|'''Multi-view registration''']] is at the heart of SPIMage processing pipeline.
* [[Fusion|'''Multi-view Fusion''']] section discusses how to combine several view into one output image
* [[Timelapse_Registration|'''Time series registration''']] removes the sample drift across long-term timelapse.

The pipeline is relatively linear as described above, we highlight the steps where [[Registration#Cross-road_in_SPIM_plugins|'''alternative routes exist''']].


Theoretical principles of the methods involved are best described on the [http://fiji.sc/SPIM_Registration SPIM pages of Fiji wiki].

  
The description of several steps of the SPIMage processing pipeline are still in the works. Particularly [[Fusion#Deconvolution|'''multi-view deconvolution''']], [[Browsing|'''data viewing''']] and [[3D_rendering|'''3D rendering''']]. Stay tuned.

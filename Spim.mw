== A Compact and Versatile Light Sheet Microscopy Platform for Research and Education ==

Selective Plane Illumination Microscope (SPIM) with sample rotation & translation. Optimized for uncompromised light sheet microscopy of samples like Drosophila embryos and spheroids while maintaining a small footprint for mobility and a reasonable price point. Epi-fluorescence and brightfield illumination, 16x/0.8 W objective, sCMOS camera. Most of the parts are off-the-shelf, with only three custom components made by Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).

== Parts ==

== Suggested modifications ==

{| class="wikitable sortable" border="1"
|-
! scope="col" class="unsortable" width="400"| Modification
! scope="col" class="unsortable" width="400"| Effort

|- align="left"
|| Switch camera to an sCMOS USB model with similar pixel size and larger chip to reduce the required computer size / enable the use of a laptop
|| Requires substantial adaptation of the software, or use of different software, e.g. µManager
|-
|- align="left"
|| Switch to µManager to make system more universal
|| Requires integration of all hardware components in µManager, which might be difficult for some components, e.g. Thorlabs APT stage
|-
|- align="left"
|| Use lasers that support direct modulation to skip AOTF, simplify illumination beam path and reduce footprint of electronics rack
|| Requires modification of software, modification of illumination beam path

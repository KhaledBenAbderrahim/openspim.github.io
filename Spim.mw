== A Compact and Versatile Light Sheet Microscopy Platform for Research and Education ==

Selective Plane Illumination Microscope (SPIM) with sample rotation & translation. Optimized for uncompromised light sheet microscopy of samples like Drosophila embryos and spheroids while maintaining a small footprint for mobility and a reasonable price point. Epi-fluorescence and brightfield illumination, 16x/0.8 W objective, sCMOS camera. Most of the parts are off-the-shelf, with only three custom components made by Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).

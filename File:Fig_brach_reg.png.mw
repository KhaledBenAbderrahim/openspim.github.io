Visualization of multiple views of a brachiopod larva during registration steps. Each angle has a different color viewed on the BigDataViewer. A Original orientation of the multiple view stacks. In order to facilitate the content-based registration (without beads) the views need to be at the same orientation. A transformation was applied to the Y axis to place each view at the same orientation. B Multiple views after transformation (left). All stacks are oriented in the same manner and have been colored individually (right). C Result of the registration step with the different views combined into a single fused stack.

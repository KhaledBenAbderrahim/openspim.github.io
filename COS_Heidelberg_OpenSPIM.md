# What we have learned

  - Patience :-)

# The hardware modifications

Because we use nikon lenses, we needed to modify the tube lens. Here is
what you need to order:

\- a Nikon compatible tube
lens: http://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=ITL200 or ask a
quote from Nikon directly (reference:  MXA20696 )

\- an adapter to host the tube lens
(http://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=SM2A20)

\- tubes to build the detection axis: connect the tube lens to the
camera  and adjust the length to so that the image is sharp on the
camera sensor (the approximate distance between the back end of the tube
lens and the camera captor is \~15.8cm) \[Everything from Thorlabs\]:

\- Adapter with External C-Mount Threads and Internal SM1 Threads
SM1A9 (to screw to the camera)

\- Adapter with External SM1 Threads and Internal SM2 Threads SM1A2 (to
connect the camera to the tube)

\- SM2 Lens Tube, 2 Thread Depth, One Retaining Ring Included
SM2L20  --\> 2 of this

\- SM2 Lens Tube, 0.3 Thread Depth, One Retaining Ring Included --\> 2
of this

\- SM2L03 "Ø2"" SM2 Rotating Adjustable Focusing Element, 0.81"" Travel"
SM2V10 (to adjust length)

\- the sample chamber: you will need to ask your workshop to adapt the
diameter of the objectives opening in the chamber to accommodate the
Nikon lenses.

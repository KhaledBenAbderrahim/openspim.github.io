From August 18th until August28th 2014 an [**EMBO practical course on
light sheet microscopy**](http://events.embo.org/14-lsm/index.html) will
be held in Dresden, Germany. The course hosts 17
[**students**](EMBO_2014_Participants "wikilink") from all over the
world, 17 [**speakers**](EMBO_2014_Speakers "wikilink") who have made
major contribution to the development of light sheet technology and 17
local [**instructors**](EMBO_2014_Instructors "wikilink") who have hands
on experience with LSFM. Companies such as Zeiss and LaVision Biotec are
bringing their equipment, supplemented by various SPIM set-ups from
academic labs in Dresden and elsewhere. We will build four OpenSPIMs
during the course using the camera and laser equipment generously loaned
by Andor, Coherent, Qimaging, PCO and Hamamatsu.

The progress of the course will be monitored on [**dedicated
pages**](EMBO_practical_course_Light_sheet_microscopy "wikilink") on the
OpenSPIM wiki. We hope to create a lot of useful content that will have
impact beyond the direct participants of the course. In particular, we
will record the technical lectures and post them on the [**program
page**](EMBO_2014_final_program "wikilink").

So stay tuned.

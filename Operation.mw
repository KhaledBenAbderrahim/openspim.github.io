Now that we have assembled the OpenSPIM microscope it is time to start using it. We will need to prepare a sample, align the light sheet (Calibration), set-up the acquisition and process the data.

= Calibration =

Before using the OpenSPIM the light sheet needs to be  [[Light-sheet Calibration|aligned]]. It means that the light sheet needs to be shaped by the optics of the system to be parallel to the imaging plane of the camera, perpendicular to the detection axis, as thin as possible, uniform across the field of view and most importantly in focus with the detection objective. Since the procedure is rather involved we provide a series of detailed videos that illustrate the process. Innovations are welcome.

Although once aligned the light sheet is rather stable it should be [[Light-sheet Calibration|aligned]] in regular intervals or whenever the image quality or point spread function of the beads looks suboptimal.

Comparison of different laser patterns in fixed bryozoan embryos. A, B Maximum intensity projection of a 16 cell stage embryo imaged with gaussian beam without (A) and with (B) structured illumination. C, D, E Maximum intensity projection of a late gastrula stage. Insets show a detail of the nuclei. C Gaussian beam. D Gaussian beam and structured illumination. E Bessel beam and structured illumination. Scale bars = 10 Âµm

= Sample raw data from Dresden's OpenSPIM =

We will explain the entire SPIMange processing (SPIM image processing) pipeline using long-term time-lapse dataset acquired in Dresden during preparation of the OpenSPIM publication. We imaged ''Drosophila melanogaster'' embryos expression His-YFP in all cells from five angles every 6 minutes throughout embryogenesis - from gastrulation until the embryo started moving which is a sign of muscle contractions. The final processed and 3d rendered dataset looks like this:

The entire multi-view time-lapse consists of 235 time points and the raw acquired ome.tiffs add up to 173 GB. Therefore, for the purposes of our tutorial we will be using the first 11 time-points of the time series.

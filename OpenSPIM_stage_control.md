# Live Window

Controlling the stage is accomplished primarily through ÂµManager's live
window: after [a pixel size has been
provided](Pixel_Size_Calibration "wikilink"), the user can simply click
and drag across the display to change the view accordingly. The scroll
wheel is used for depth/focus movement. The OpenSPIM software provides
an additional dimension of control in the rotational motor: holding the
Alt key while moving the mouse side-to-side will cause the sample to be
rotated about a previously-determined axis.

# Alternative for precise control

Alternatively, the stage controls tab of the OpenSPIM plugin can be used
to move to specific locations.

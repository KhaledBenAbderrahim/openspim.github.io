* [http://loci.wisc.edu/ The Laboratory of Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI)] run by [http://loci.wisc.edu/people/kevin-eliceiri Kevin Eliceiri] at the University Wisconsin-Madison. It uses a Coherent Cube laser and a Hamamatsu Orca R^2 camera, being controlled by a 32-bit Windows XP computer.

* The OpenSPIM software was developed in this lab by Johannes Schindelin and Luke Stuyvenberg, and tested and refined with the help of Julie Last and Jayne Squirrel (see the [[People]] page for details), using that setup. The source code is hosted on [https://github.com/openspim/micromanager GitHub].

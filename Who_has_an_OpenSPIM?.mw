* dual sided detection with 2 Photometrics [http://www.photometrics.com/products/ccdcams/coolsnap-myo.php:l  Coolsnap Myo].
* We included a Thorlabs [http://www.thorlabs.de/NewGroupPage9.cfm?ObjectGroup_ID=927?l shutter] in the beam path.
* For brightfield illumination during sample positioning we use a lamp that is temporarily inserted in one of the filter holders.

* The Light Microscopy Facility at the [http://www.http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/ Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology]
* Our system features two-sided excitation with adjustable focus of the sheet lenses (Olympus 5x/0.15 air MPLFLN5X) which sit outside the imaging chamber to cope with different refractive indices.
* 4 laser lines - combined in a separate laser bed and fed into a fibre (405nm & 640nm: both Coherent Cube; 488nm & 561nm: both Coherent Sapphire) 
* The imaging chamber can be heated to e.g. 37C for live cell imaging purposes.
* Imaging lens is a Nikon 16x/0.8NA (N16XLWD-PF) with 3mm WD.
* In front of the camera is a Thorlabs 6-position filter wheel (FW102C)
* The entire system is portable (sort of) and modified to be laser safe as it is operated within our multi-user facility.

* I am interested in morphogenetic processes during early development of arthropods like the water flea Daphnia magna, the woodlouse Porcellio scaber or the beachhopper Parhyale hawaiensis. Using the SPIM technique for live imaging experiments enables us to observe dynamic and complex processes like gastrulation and beginning morphogenesis. 
* We implemented a Coherent Obis 561 nm laser and a Hamamatsu OrcaFlash4 sCMOS camera into the OpenSPIM system. The system runs at the moment with just one-side illumination. However, the sample chamber is already made for dual-side illumination (2x 10x illumination and 16x detection). Additionally we integrated a Nikon-module that allows us to increases our range of magnification (1x, 1,25x, 1,5x, 2x).

* Temperature, CO2 and O2 controlled liquid exchange/perfusion system for live cell imaging.
* OpenSPIM has been used for live cell imaging: different cell types and spheroids in different 3D culture matrices, e.g. in Matrigel, collagen, myogel and fibrin mounted inside FEP tubes, and also for imaging living mouse skin cancer biopsies. It has also been used for whole mount stained and/or transgenic (expressing tdTomato, GFP, mCherryâ€¦) fixed samples, typically mouse embryonic kidneys, pieces of adult mouse tissues like heart, liver, fat, lung etc.

* The [http://web.medicine.iupui.edu/icbm/ Indiana Center for Biological Microscopy at Indiana University School of Medicine].
* We extended the base L-SPIM design for use in a core facility by including additional excitation wavelengths and support for live imaging.  We are imaging with an ORCA Flash 4.0 v2 using CameraLink.
* To support more fluorophores we incorporated five laser lines (442, 488, 514, 568 and 647 nm) with AOTF modulation controlled via an [https://www.arduino.cc Arduino] based [http://www.ti.com/product/tlv5618a 6 channel  DAC].  Emission wavelength filtering is with a workhorse [http://www.sutter.com/IMAGING/lambda102.html Sutter Lambda 10-2].  Multichannel acquisition is fully controlled (AOTF, filter wheels, etc) by a custom version of the SPIM Acquisition Plugin and derivations of the Arduino device adapter for MicroManager.  To assess laser power, a motorized mirror and ThorLabs detector have been incorporated prior to beam shaping.
*To support live imaging we have incorporated a perfusion and temperature control system into the standard L-SPIM chamber(no drilling etc.) built with off-the-shelf components (shout-out to [http://www.adafruit.com Adafruit] and [http://www.sparkfun.com Sparkfun]).  It is Arduino based and relies on a bunch of pumps and thermistors.  MicroManager integration and a CO2 loop is in the works (anyone with experience implementing [http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Amphenol-Advanced-Sensors/T6615-50K/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvhkhGuTKDegrl2ezYd2qTk amphenol CO2 sensors]?).
* Our OpenSPIM is fully contained to simplify laser safety. To facilitate alignment and sample positioning a secondary camera driven by a [https://www.raspberrypi.org RaspberryPi] provides a live image of the chamber with oblique RGB LED illumination from an Arduino and PWM via the 16 channel [http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/TLC5940 TLC5940].
* To aid in sample positioning a knob bar is under development with four free-turning knobs-one for each axis with position feed-back.
* IU OpenSPIM has been used for imaging of Zebrafish (live heart-beat and fixed and cleared tissue), organoids, and tissue samples including rat kidneys-most in FEP tubing.  It has also been a testbed for new technologies and methodologies.

* We are the Laboratory of Neurobiology at the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland [http://www.nencki.gov.pl/pracownia-neurobiologii]
* Using OpenSPIM as the starting point, we developed a cleared-tissue imaging SPIM system using dry 4X/0.13 Nikon objectives with WD of 17 mm, or about 25 mm in immersion
* We use 3D printed chambers for CLARITY- and CUBIC-cleared tissue and glass cuvettes for BABB-cleared tissue
* Recently we replaced the Picard stage with one by Standa, with greatly increased speed and travel range at comparable cost
* Also recently a second illumination arm was added, converting the setup from the L to the T configuration
* Ar-Ion laser (458/488/515 nm with manual filter wheel for wavelength selection) used for illumination
* beam height is raised to 65 mm, mainly for compability with the argon laser
* we have demonstrated whole mouse and rat brain imaging (see [http://www.nature.com/articles/srep28209/ paper])

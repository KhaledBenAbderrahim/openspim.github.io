* [http://loci.wisc.edu/ The Laboratory of Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI)] run by [http://loci.wisc.edu/people/kevin-eliceiri Kevin Eliceiri] at the University Wisconsin-Madison. It uses a Coherent Cube laser and a Hamamatsu Orca R^2 camera, being controlled by a 32-bit Windows XP computer.

* The OpenSPIM software was developed in this lab by Johannes Schindelin and Luke Stuyvenberg, and tested and refined with the help of Julie Last and Jayne Squirrel (see the [[People]] page for details), using that setup. The source code is hosted on [https://github.com/openspim/micromanager GitHub].

* This setup slightly differs from the specifications of OpenSPIM v1.0. In particular we use a  [http://www.cobolt.se/mld488nm.html Cobolt laser], Nikon lenses and an [http://www.hamamatsucameras.com/flash4/l Orca4], the whole running under Windows7 Pro.

* I am interested in morphogenetic processes during early development of arthropods like the water flea Daphnia magna, the woodlouse Porcellio scaber or the beachhopper Parhyale hawaiensis. Using the SPIM technique for live imaging experiments enables us to observe dynamic and complex processes like gastrulation and beginning morphogenesis. 
* We implemented a Coherent Obis 561 nm laser and a Hamamatsu OrcaFlash4 sCMOS camera into the OpenSPIM system. The system runs at the moment with just one-side illumination. However, the sample chamber is already made for dual-side illumination (2x 10x illumination and 16x detection). Additionally we integrated a Nikon-module that allows us to increases our range of magnification (1x, 1,25x, 1,5x, 2x).

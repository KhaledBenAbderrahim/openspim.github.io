Zebrafish embryos should be mounted according to the imaging needs,
e.g.:

1.  for short-term imaging: in 1.5% agarose inside a glass capillary,
    pushed out for imaging (the classic approach), w/ optional FEP tube
    support
2.  for long-term imaging: in 0.1% agarose inside a polymer (FEP) tube
3.  for long-term cardiac imaging: in 3% methylcellulose inside a
    polymer (FEP) tube

1.  flush tubes with 1 M NaOH, use syringe with attached needle
2.  transfer flushed tubes to fresh Falcon with 0.5 M NaOH, use forceps
3.  put the Falcon in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min
4.  from now on, touch the tubes only with gloves and/or forceps\!
5.  transfer the tubes from the Falcon into small basin with ddH2O and
    flush them with ddH2O
6.  flush the tubes with 70% EtOH
7.  transfer the tubes to a fresh Falcon with 70% EtOH
8.  put the Falcon in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min
9.  cut the tube to small pieces of appropriate length
10. transfer the tubes to a fresh Falcon with ddH2O for storage

### prepare syringes w/ FEP tubes

  - take a cleaned and cut FEP tube and carefully attach it to the
    needle
  - do not touch the part of the tube that will later be used for
    imaging

## Short-term imaging I: the classic approach

The method of choice mounting Zebrafish embryos is very similar to the
one for [mounting Drosophila
embryos](Drosophila_embryo_sample_preparation#Mounting_of_the_embryos "wikilink").
It is simple and straight-forward, but restricts the embryo from
growing. This limits the usable time frame for imaging to about 1-2
hours from the mounting.

<File:Embedding> glass-capillary.png <File:Embedding> fep-tube.png

If required for multi-view registration, add fluorescent beads to the
melted aliquots of agarose. Keep the agarose aliquots at 38 deg Celsius.
Transfer a Zebrafish embryo of choice to the agarose and take it up with
a glass capillary (inner diameter around 1 mm) and a plunger. Let the
agarose solidify and keep the embryo in the capillary submerged in fish
medium. For imaging, push out the part of the agarose which contains the
embryo. If required, add Tricaine to the imaging chamber.

## Short-term imaging II: FEP tube as additional support

<File:Embedding> glass-capillary.png <File:Embedding> fep-tube.png

  - take up an embryo w/ a FEP tube which is attached to a needle and
    syringe
  - wait a couple of minutes for the agarose to solidify and cut off the
    tube from the needle
  - store the prepared sample in a 1.5 ml reaction tube filled with E3
    fish medium
  - quickly proceed w/ imaging

## Long-term imaging

The limitations of mounting a zebrafish embryo in 1.5% agarose can be
overcome by using a lower concentration of agarose plus a transparent
solid support. To achieve unpersuaded image quality, the refractive
index of the support has to match that of the medium. A good choice is
FEP ([fluorinated ethylene
propylene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorinated_ethylene_propylene)).
This polymer has a refractive index close to the one of water, and can
be ordered as tube in various diameters right from the shelf. For
imaging, the Zebrafish embryo is kept inside the cleaned and coated
tube, embedded in 0.1% agarose with some Tricaine.

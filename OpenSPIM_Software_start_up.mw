# Launch Fiji using Fiji.app/ImageJ-win32.exe.
# Once Fiji has started, you can open µManager Studio from Plugins -> Micro-Manager -> Micro-Manager Studio.
## If this is the first time you've launched µManager, you will have to [[Downloads#Initial_hardware_configuration|configure the hardware]] to continue.
# From µManager, click Plugins -> Acquire SPIM image to launch the OpenSPIM plugin.
## The Live Window will open automatically if it is not already open.

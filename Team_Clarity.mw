'''Our first try: 3D Reconstraction of Drosophila Embryo.'''

=== Mice development ===

=== Branching organs ===

Mouse embryonic kidneys at E11.5, E12 and E12.5 were imaged with Zeiss Lightsheet  Z.1. Light sheet microscopy provides a cellular resolution at the organ scale. 
Images are coming soon.

=== 3D cultures ===

=== Development of bryozoans and brachiopods ===

==== Live samples ====

Colonies of ''Membranipora membranacea'' were shipped twice from Bergen, Norway. In both cases colonies arrived dead or mostly-dead. However, I managed to scrape better-looking embryos from inside the zooids. Some embryos got activated and started cleaving. I tried to image them in the ''Scanned Lightsheet SPIM'' (Meyers SPIM) since it has temperature control in the chamber and is adapted to small samples. Embryos were stained with a membrane marker (FM 4-64). Unfortunately, we only manage to acquire a small time-lapse from an embryo that was not healthy:

==== Fixed samples ====

I brought different stages of bryozoan embryos and larvae. There are two combinations of staining, Sytox Green + Phalloidin Alexa 647 and DAPI + Bodipy FL.

After a rough [[Alignment of laser|alignment of the laser]] you can continue with the installation of the refractive optics.

=== Install the first lens of the beam expanding telescope ===

===== Objects needed =====

*1x 1/2" f = 25 mm spherical lens assembly on it's rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

None

===== [http://youtu.be/1CGBz9cj7UU How and where to install the beam expander on the rail system] =====

Put the 1/2" f = 25 mm spherical lens assembly on it's rail carrier on to the 300 mm dovetail rail near the laser and two 1/2" mirror assemblies with the tightening knob facing away from the laser and the lens facing the 1" mirror in the direction of the arrow on the lens housing. Position it between 50 to 75 mm away from the last 1/2" mirror surface (it doesn't really matter so much as how far away the first lens is because the entry and exit beams of the beam expander telescope system will be parallel, not focused or divergent), and tighten the tightening knob so that it doesn't move along the dovetail rail.

=== Install the second lens of the beam expanding telescope ===

===== Objects needed =====

*1x 1/2" f = 50 mm spherical lens assembly on it's rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

None

===== [http://youtu.be/1CGBz9cj7UU How and where to install the beam expander on the rail system] =====

Put the 1/2" f = 50 mm spherical lens assembly on it's rail carrier on to the 300 mm dovetail rail near the laser and behind the first 1/2" f = 25 mm spherical lens assembly in relation to the direction of the light path with the tightening knob facing away from the laser and the lens facing the 1" mirror in the direction of the arrow on the lens housing. position it about 75 mm away from the first 1/2" f = 25 mm spherical lens assembly, and tighten the tightening knob so that it doesn't move along the dovetail rail.

== Cylindrical Lens in Place ==

Install the cylindrical lens assembly on the 300 mm dovetail rail around 50 mm from the 1" mirror with the lettering of the rotating index mount facing the reflective surface of the mirror. To adjust the focus of the cylindrical lens, shine the laser at a very low intensity through the beam expanding telescope and into the cylindrical lens. Then move the cylindrical lens assembly along the axis of the 300 mm dovetail rail until you find the thinnest line in the middle of the 1" mirror. Turn the tightening knob on the modified rail carrier until it is tight enough to fix the assembly in place.

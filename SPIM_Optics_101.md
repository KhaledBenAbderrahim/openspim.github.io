description: Introduction to SPIM Optics

In order to build an OpenSPIM it is important to understand the optics principles behind its function and the role of the various components. Jan Krieger started assembling an excellent set of pages that do just that.

This set of pages is intended to assemble a short introduction to the necessary principles of optics that allow you to understand how a SPIM works. This should also help when building, modifying or aligning a SPIM. It is distributed over several subpages, each covering a special topic:

1.  **[SPIM Optics 101/Theoretical basics](SPIM_Optics_101_Theoretical_basics)**: Introduces basics of optics (geometric optic, gaussian beams, ...)
    1.  [Geometric Optics](SPIM_Optics_101_Theoretical_basics#geometric_optics)
    2.  [Gaussian Beams](SPIM_Optics_101_Theoretical_basics#gaussian_beam_optics)
2.  **[SPIM Optics 101/Practical Hints](SPIM_Optics_101_Practical_Hints)**: gives general hints and tips, when setting up optics.
3.  [Laser Safety](Laser_Safety)

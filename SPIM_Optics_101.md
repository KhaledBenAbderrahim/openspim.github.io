This set of pages is intended to assemble a short introduction to the necessary principles of optics that allow you to understand how a SPIM works. This should also help when building, modifying or aligning a SPIM. It is distributed over several subpages, each covering a special topic:

# '''[[SPIM Optics 101/Theoretical basics]]''': Introduces basics of optics (geometric optic, gaussian beams, ...)
## [[SPIM_Optics_101/Theoretical_basics#Geometric_Optics|Geometric Optics]]
## [[SPIM_Optics_101/Theoretical_basics#Gaussian_Beam_Optics|Gaussian Beams]]
# '''[[SPIM Optics 101/Practical Hints]]''': gives general hints and tips, when setting up optics.
# '''[[Laser Safety]]
'''

This set of pages is intended to assemble a short introduction to the
necessary principles of optics that allow you to understand how a SPIM
works. This should also help when building, modifying or aligning a
SPIM. It is distributed over several subpages, each covering a special
topic:

1.  **[SPIM Optics 101/Theoretical basics](SPIM_Optics_101/Theoretical_basics)**: Introduces
    basics of optics (geometric optic, gaussian beams, ...)
    1.  [Geometric Optics](SPIM_Optics_101/Theoretical_basics#Geometric_Optics)
    2.  [Gaussian Beams](SPIM_Optics_101/Theoretical_basics#Gaussian_Beam_Optics)
2.  **[SPIM Optics 101/Practical Hints](SPIM_Optics_101/Practical_Hints)**: gives general
    hints and tips, when setting up optics.
3.  Laser Safety](Laser_Safety)

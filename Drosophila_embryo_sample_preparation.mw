The basic idea is to embed the Drosophila embryos into an Agarose column. For the [http://fiji.sc/SPIM_Registration SPIM registration], we embed fluorescent, sub-resolution beads, too.

= Notes =

We use 1-1.5% Agarose in the final mix, otherwise the optical clarity is greatly reduced. We also use standard bleach to remove the egg shell.

= Walkthrough =

Our flies live in custom-made cages. These are large, plastic vials with a fine grid on the bottom:

To get eggs of a deterministic age, we first starve the flies and then feed them yeast-based food in another cage with fresh agar in the cap:

By switching the flies out of that cage after, say, two hours, the eggs are guaranteed to be at most two hours old.

Now it is time to prepare the Agarose:

Put beads into the agarose and vortex for a good amount of time (one minute at least):

Now prepare the PBS to wash the eggs in:

We will use a sieve like this to filter out the embryos after bleaching off the egg shell:

We use standard bleach:

Now pick the embryos gently with a regular brush:

Put them into the Agarose with the beads:

Now put them into a capillary. You can use the capillary forces to get the embryos into the capillaries. Try to put them as central as possible for the best quality of the reconstruction:

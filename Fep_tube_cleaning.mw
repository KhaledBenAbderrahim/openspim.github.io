This protocol is an important part of sample embedding with FEP tubes, e.g. [[Zebrafish_embryo_sample_preparation|Zebrafish embryo sample preparation]].

=== material ===
* FEP tubes (Bola S1815-04, inner diameter 0.8 mm, outer diameter 1.6 mm)
* ultrasonicator
* 1 M NaOH (Merck)
* 0.5 M NaOH
* double-distilled H2O
* 70% ethanol
* syringe filter (Millex-HV PVDF 0.45 Âµm)
* B. Braun [http://www.bbraun.com/cps/rde/xchg/bbraun-com/hs.xsl/products.html?prid=PRID00000578 Omnifix F Solo 1 ml Syringe]
* B. Braun needle (100 Sterican, blunt)

=== procedure ===

# flush tubes with 1 M NaOH, use syringe with attached needle 
# transfer flushed tubes to fresh Falcon with 0.5 M NaOH, use forceps
# put the Falcon in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min
# from now on, touch the tubes only with gloves and/or forceps!
# transfer the tubes from the Falcon into small basin with ddH2O and flush them with ddH2O
# flush the tubes with 70% EtOH
# transfer the tubes to a fresh Falcon with 70% EtOH
# put the Falcon in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min
# transfer the tubes to a fresh Falcon with ddH2O for storage

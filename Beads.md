This page is about fluorescent beads, used as fiduciary markers for multi-view registration in light sheet microscopy.

## Estapor Fluorescent Microspheres

  - [website](https://www.estapor.com/estapor/en/fluorescent_microspheres/fluorescent_microspheres/19.html)
  - stock concentration for SPIM: 14 µl 0.5 µm beads in 14 ml medium
    (sample dependent, e.g. PBS/T for fruit fly, E3 for zebrafish)

### Tips & tricks

  - extended vortexing and/or treatment in ultrasonic bath is crucial for homogeneous bead distribution and successful bead detection
  - evaluate the bead concentration in agarose w/o specimen

### F-XC050

  - diameter 0.5 µm
  - "green" emission (see spectra)
  - EX 488 nm
  - appliations:
      - fiduciary marker in "green" detection channel for bright "green" fluorescence
      - evaluation/adjustment of red-green overlay

### F-Y050

  - diameter 0.5 µm
  - "yellow" emission (see spectra)
  - EX 488/561 nm
  - applications:
      - fiduciary marker in "green" detection channel for weak "green" fluorescence
      - fiduciary marker in "red" detection channel for "green" fluorescence

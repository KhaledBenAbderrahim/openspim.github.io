## A Compact and Versatile Light Sheet Microscopy Platform for Research and Education

![Spim\_solidworks-screenshot19.png](Spim_solidworks-screenshot19.png
"Spim_solidworks-screenshot19.png")

Selective Plane Illumination Microscope (SPIM) with sample rotation &
translation. Optimized for uncompromised light sheet microscopy of
samples like Drosophila embryos and spheroids while maintaining a small
footprint for mobility and a reasonable price point. Epi-fluorescence
and brightfield illumination, 16x/0.8 W objective, sCMOS camera. Most of
the parts are off-the-shelf, with only three custom components made by
Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).

## Assembly

1.  Mount sample chamber
2.  Attach cage rods for illumination and detection arms to sample
    chamber
3.  Mount objective lenses using silicone
4.  Start assembling the detection arm
5.  Adjust distance camera - tube lens by focusing to infinity
6.  Finalize detection arm
7.  Assemble motor unit and sample holder
8.  Assemble illumination arm with mirrors, but without lenses
9.  Align laser to center of cage system and sample chamber
10. Add circular lenses step by step, adjust focus and collimation where
    necessary
11. Add cylindrical lens and adjust light sheet to focal plane of
    detection objective
12. Add laser shielding to breadboard

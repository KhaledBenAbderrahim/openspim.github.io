= Bright-field illumination =

Michael Redd from the Cell Imaging Core Facility at the University of Utah put together an Arduino-based solution to get proper bright-field illumination in an OpenSPIM setup: [[Brightfield]].

= Shutter =

Instructions to make an Arduino-controlled shutter compatible with uManager: [http://george.ph.utexas.edu/~meyrath/informal/shutter.pdf paper by Todd P. Meyrath] and [https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Control_laser_shutters_with_Arduino tutorial on the uManager page].

= OpenSPIM for large samples = 

==Field of view==

The original OpenSPIM uses a 2X expander to enlarge the laser beam to 2 mm. For larger samples a larger field of view can be preferable. This means that you will need a larger beam to create a taller light sheet. Change the second beam expander lens to f=75 mm or 100 mm and increase the distance between lenses accordingly.

==Objectives==

Immersion objectives with long working distance are hard to find. However, at low NA and moderate magnification, a dry objective will also work; the higher NA, the more spherical aberrations will be present. Keep in mind that when using a dry objective in immersion, the WD will increase (approximately by a factor equal to the RI of the new medium, eg. 17 mm in air will increase to  22.6 mm in water).

==Example parts list==

The table below lists the parts used by the OpenSPIM for brains setup built by Monika Pawłowska (Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw).

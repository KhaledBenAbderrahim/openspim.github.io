== Ø1/2" mirror mount assemblies ==

===== Objects needed =====

*2x Ø1/2" mirror mounts with installed mirrors
*2x 19 mm stilts with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body
*2x M4x40 mm capscrews
*2x M4 nuts
*2x ThorLabs part #: SD1 M4 to M6 adapter
*2x ThorLabs part #: RC1 rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x needle nosed pliers
*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/N_S5flUvKIE/ How to assemble the small mirror mounts to their rail carriers] =====

Put the M4x40 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 19 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 15-20 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. Set the base of the mirror on the stilt through one of its holes, and screw a M4 nut over the remaining threading of the M4 capscrew. Grab and hold the M4 nut with the needle nosed pliers and from the bottom of the RC1 rail carrier use the 3 mm hex key/driver to screw the capscrew tight. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of these assemblies when aligning the laser.

== Ø1/2" spherical lens mount assemblies ==

===== Objects needed =====

*5x Ø1/2" optical mounts with installed optical components (2x <i>f</i> = 25 mm achromat, 2x <i>f</i> = 50 mm achromat & 1x 1 mm alignment tool)
*5x 15 mm stilts with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body (either self made or ThorLabs part #: SC1 - spacer)
*5x M4x25 mm capscrews
*5x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*5x ThorLabs part #: RC1 - rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/tUDM_Fxm3-0 How to mount the spherical lenses on to their rail carriers] =====

Put the M4x25 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 15 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 5 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the lens mount is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of these assemblies when aligning the laser.

== Vertical slit mechanism ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Vertical slit mechanism
*1x 13 mm stilt with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body 
*1x M4x20 mm capscrew
*1x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*1x ThorLabs part #: RC1 - rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/pgHzF4xwUTU/ How to mount the vertical slit on to its rail carrier] =====

Put the M4x22 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 13 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 2 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the vertical slit mechanism is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of this assembly when aligning the laser.

== Iris assembly ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Iris mechanism
*1x 10 mm stilt with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body 
*1x M4x20 mm capscrew
*1x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*1x ThorLabs part #: RC1 - rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/r3XgT8I1RIU/ How to mount the iris on its rail modified carrier] =====

Put the M4x22 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 2-3 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 2-3 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the Ø1" optical mount, where the iris mechanism resides, is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of this assembly when aligning the laser.

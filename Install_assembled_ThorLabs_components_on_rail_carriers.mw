== Ø1" mirror mount assemblies ==

===== Objects needed =====

*2x Ø1" [http://thorlabs.com/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=POLARIS-K1 Polaris K1][http://thorlabs.com/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=POLARIS-K1-H H] mirror mounts with installed mirrors
*2x [http://openspim.org/File:Mirror_rail-carrier_stilt_5-5mm.PDF 5.5 mm] stilts with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body
*2x M4x25 mm capscrews
*2x M4 nuts
*2x ThorLabs part #: [http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=SD1 SD1] M4 to M6 adapter
*2x ThorLabs part #: [http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=RC1 RC1] rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x needle nosed pliers
*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== How to assemble the 1" mirror mounts to their rail carriers =====

Put the M4x25 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 5.5 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 3-5 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. Set the base of the mirror on the stilt through the hole that will put the horizontal adjustment screw on the left side of the assembly, and screw a M4 nut over the remaining threading of the M4 capscrew. Grab and hold the M4 nut with the needle nosed pliers and from the bottom of the RC1 rail carrier use the 3 mm hex key/driver to screw the capscrew tight. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of these assemblies when aligning the laser.

''Note: The video shows the use of Ø1/2" mirror mounts, the Madison system uses them but the Dresden system uses the Ø1" mirror mounts. The video was made in Madison during the construction of it's OpenSPIM''

== Ø1/2" spherical lens mount assemblies ==

===== Objects needed =====

*6x Ø1/2" optical mounts with installed optical components (2x ''f<'' = 25 mm achromat, 2x ''f'' = 50 mm achromat & 2x 1 mm ground glass alignment disk)
*6x [http://openspim.org/File:OpenSPIM_Stilt_1-2in-Lens.PDF 14.95 mm] stilts with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body
*6x M4x25 mm capscrews
*6x ThorLabs part #: [http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=SD1 SD1] -  M4 to M6 adapter
*6x ThorLabs part #: [http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=RC1 RC1] - rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== How to mount the spherical lenses on to their rail carriers =====

Put the M4x25 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adaptor, then the capscrew/adaptor assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 14.95 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 5 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the lens mount is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of these assemblies when aligning the laser.

== Vertical slit mechanism ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x [http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=VA100/M VA100/M] Vertical slit mechanism
*1x [http://openspim.org/File:Vertical-slit_rail-carrier_stilt_13-17mm.PDF 13.17 mm] stilt with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body 
*1x M4 x 22 mm capscrew (cut a few millimeters off of a 25 mm capscrew)
*1x ThorLabs part #: [http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=SD1 SD1] M4 to M6 adapter
*1x ThorLabs part #: [http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=RC1 RC1] rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== How to mount the vertical slit on to its rail carrier =====

Put the M4x22 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 13 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 2 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the vertical slit mechanism is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of this assembly when aligning the laser.

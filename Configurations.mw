The flexibility of light sheet microscopes such as OpenSPIM allows for different configurations. The standard setup consists of one illumination arm ("1I") and one detection arm ("1D"). One can add a second illumination arm ("2I") to improve the homogeneity of the light sheet illumination and/or to reduce the need for rotation. A second detection arm ("2D") enables the simultaneous acquisition from both sides.

= Development with IntelliJ =


== Setup ==

* install JDK 8 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* install the latest Fiji version _without JRE_ from http://fiji.sc
* of course, install IntelliJ from http://jetbrains.com
* start Fiji and add the MicroManager-dev update site via _Help > Update... > Manage Update Sites > Add_ - the address of the update site is http://sites.imagej.net/Micro-Manager-dev/
* restart Fiji to install the MicroManager components fully.

== SPIMacquisition source code and import ==

* acquire the SPIMAcquisition source code via git clone from https://github.com/openspim/spimacquisition
* import the folder you just cloned into IntelliJ as a Maven project.
* in the Module settings (reachable via right-click on the project or by pressing `F4`), add both directories `[Fiji]/jars` and `[Fiji]/plugins/Micro-Manager` to _Global Libraries_.
* in the Module settings, go to _Artifacts_ and add a _JAR_ artifact with _From modules with dependencies_. Choose SPIMacquisition as main class.
* the module is now ready to build - click _Build > Make Project_ or _Build > Build artefacts..._ - the output JAR will be put in the folder _out/artifacts/SPIMacquisition_JAR_ with the name `SPIMacquisition.jar` - you can copy this file then to `[Fiji]/mmplugins` and use it in MicroManager

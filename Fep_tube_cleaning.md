This protocol is an important part of sample embedding with FEP tubes,
e.g. [Zebrafish embryo sample
preparation](Zebrafish_embryo_sample_preparation "wikilink").

### material

  - FEP tubes (Bola S1815-04, inner diameter 0.8 mm, outer diameter 1.6
    mm)
  - ultrasonicator
  - 1 M NaOH (Merck)
  - 0.5 M NaOH
  - double-distilled H2O
  - 70% ethanol
  - syringe filter (Millex-HV PVDF 0.45 Âµm)
  - B. Braun [Omnifix F Solo 1 ml
    Syringe](http://www.bbraun.com/cps/rde/xchg/bbraun-com/hs.xsl/products.html?prid=PRID00000578)
  - B. Braun needle (100 Sterican, blunt)

### procedure

1.  flush tubes with 1 M NaOH, use syringe with attached needle
2.  transfer flushed tubes to fresh Falcon with 0.5 M NaOH, use forceps
3.  put the Falcon in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min
4.  from now on, touch the tubes only with gloves and/or forceps\!
5.  transfer the tubes from the Falcon into small basin with ddH2O and
    flush them with ddH2O
6.  flush the tubes with 70% EtOH
7.  transfer the tubes to a fresh Falcon with 70% EtOH
8.  put the Falcon in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min
9.  transfer the tubes to a fresh Falcon with ddH2O for storage

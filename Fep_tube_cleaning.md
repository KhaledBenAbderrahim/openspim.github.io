This protocol is an important part of sample embedding with FEP tubes, e.g. [Zebrafish embryo sample preparation](Zebrafish_embryo_sample_preparation).
### material

  - FEP tubes (Bola S1815-04, inner diameter 0.8 mm, outer diameter 1.6 mm)
  - ultrasonicator
  - 1 M NaOH (Merck)
  - 0.5 M NaOH
  - double-distilled H2O
  - 70% ethanol
  - syringe filter (Millex-HV PVDF 0.45 Âµm)
  - B. Braun [Omnifix F Solo 1 ml Syringe](https://www.bbraun.com/en/products/b/omnifix-f-solo.html)
  - B. Braun needle (100 Sterican, blunt)

### Procedure

1.  Flush tubes with 1 M NaOH, use syringe with attached needle
2.  Transfer flushed tubes to fresh Falcon with 0.5 M NaOH, use forceps
3.  Put the Falcon in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min
4.  From now on, touch the tubes only with gloves and/or forceps!
5.  Transfer the tubes from the Falcon into small basin with ddH2O and flush them with ddH2O
6.  Flush the tubes with 70% EtOH
7.  Transfer the tubes to a fresh Falcon with 70% EtOH
8.  Put the Falcon in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min
9.  Transfer the tubes to a fresh Falcon with ddH2O for storage

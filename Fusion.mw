= Fusion = 

[[Registration|'''Registered''']] multi-view OpenSPIM data need to be fused into a single output image in order to achieve complete coverage of a large specimen. Fusion means here combining information from different views in areas where the views overlap. Several strategies to do so exist, many are published (ADD REFS LATER). We will focus here on the two fusion methods implemented in Fiji - the content based multiview fusion and multiview deconvolution.


''Note that fused data are different, not necessarily better compared to raw SPIM data. Both fusion algorithms described here potentially deteriorate the quality of the data in some respects while improving other aspects. We will discuss the fusion artefacts in the respective sections. However it should be said that sometimes it is beneficial to NOT fuse the data at all and perform analysis on the raw registered image stacks (for example segmentation of cells in the individual views and reconciliation of the results in the segmentation domain). In the section on of this tutorial on [[Browsing|'''browsing''']] we will describe how to view raw registered multi-view OpenSPIM views.

= Content Based Fusion =

The content based multi-view fusion evaluates local information entropy in the areas where several views overlap and combines the views by enhancing  the low entropy information from the view containing useful data while suppressing the high entropy noise from the blurred data in other views. The principles of the method are discussed in depth [http://fiji.sc/SPIM_Registration_Method#Image_Fusion_and_blending '''here'''] and the parameters of the Fiji plugin implementing the method are described [http://fiji.sc/Multi-View_Fusion '''here''']. As before we enhance these technical description with tutorial style walk through using the [[Raw_data|sample OpenSPIM data]]. 

Content based multi-view fusion requires significant [[Pre-requisites|computational resources]]. The input raw data stacks are large and when they are transformed to the position where they overlap, the bounding box of the output volume can become several fold larger. To process on such large volumes can take significant amount of time and it may fail due to insufficient memory even on the largest computer systems (we did experience out of memory exceptions on a system with 128GB of RAM!). Therefore we will proceed sequentially, minimising the memory footprint.

* first we will fuse '''four times down-sampled''' data with all computationally demanding options turned off - see [[Fusion#First_approximate_run|'''First approximate run''']].
* next we will '''crop''' the output volume to include only the specimen - see [[Fusion#Cropping|'''Cropping''']].
* finally we will fuse the '''cropped''' volume with all options turned on - see [[Fusion#Final_run|'''Final run''']].

[[File:Screenshot-fusion-pluginselection.png|thumb|200px|right|Launching content based multi-view fusion]]
We start the Content based fusion plugin from '''Plugins->SPIM Registration->Multi-view fusion''' (or pressing letter '''l''' and typing Multi etc.).

[[File:Screenshot-Multi-view fusion-dialog1.png|thumb|400px|right|Screenshot of the first fusion dialog]]
In the first dialog we will accept the default '''Single channel''' channel type option and click '''Ok'''.

The second dialog should look familiar. In fact if you have run the [[Registration|'''registration''']] of timepoint '''5''' before it should be pre-filled with all the necessary data (SPIM data directory, Pattern of SPIM file, Time-points to process and Angles to process). See [[Registration|registrarion]] tutorial for details on the fields. To proceed with fusion of time-point 5 click '''Ok'''.

----
[[File:Screenshot-Multi-View Fusion-main-dialog.png|thumb|400px|right|Screenshot of the first fusion dialog]]
The main dialog of Content based fusion plugin starts with a pull-down '''Registration of channel 0'''. This pull down should have only a single option available '''Individual registration to channel 0'''. Later on, after we perform [[Timelapse_Registration|timelapse registration]] there will be other possibilities. For now it is sufficient to know that this field refers to the ''.registration'' files in the ''/registration'' directory that contains the [[Registration#Output|registration results]] (affine transformation matrices). The files need to exist in that directory otherwise the fusion will fail.


Second field '''Fusion Method''' can be left as default, we want to fuse the data into a single image.


On our 128GB computer we can '''Process All views in parallel''' we have enough memory. However if you are using a lesser computer and getting the so-called ''Java heap space'' exception after launching fusion, you need to choose to process '''2''' or maybe only '''one view''' in parallel. ''Note that this is unlilkely to be a problem if you follow this tutorial since we will downsample the image four times, making it rather small - see below''.


'''Blending''', '''Content based weights''' and '''Content based weights (fast approximate)''' are options that take time and so we leave the checkboxes '''unclicked''' for this initial quick run. We will return to them later when discussing the [[Fusion#Final_run|'''final run''']].

Importantly, to speed up the processing we enter '''4''' into the '''Downsample output image n-times'''.

We will leave the '''cropping''' fields at 0 (we return them in the chapter [[Fusion#Cropping|'''cropping''']].

Finally, the last pull down menu '''Fused image output''' allows us to choose to either

* ''Display only'' - simply display the output without saving
* ''Save 2d-slices, all in one directory'' - save the output volume into a single directory one image per slice. ''Note that when processing long-term time-lapse this can amount to literally hundreds of thousands of images, it has benefits in terms of loading the data into Fiji as virtual stack, but your file system may not like it, thus...
* ''Save 2d-slices, one directory per timepoint'' - is a more sensible option, it will put all slices for one timepoint into a directory named by the timepoint index, i.e. for timepoint 5 it will be directory '''output/5'''


We are ready to launch the fusion by clicking '''OK'''.

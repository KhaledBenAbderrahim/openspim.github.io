The [Lightsheet
Z.1](http://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en_de/products/imaging-systems/lightsheet-z-1.html)
is a commercial lightsheet platform developed by Zeiss AG.

The microscope is operated via the propriatory software ZEN. During data
acquisition, it is possible to "stream" data, which basically means that
images are saved to the hard drive (or server) as they are taken. The
way data is saved can be set in the "Streaming tool window" in the
"Maintain" tab. For example, different time points in a time lapse
acquisition and/or different views in a multiview acquisition can be
saved as different files. These settings may be important if you want to
do multiview registration in Fiji or other packages.

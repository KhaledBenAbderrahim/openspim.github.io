The [Lightsheet Z.1](http://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en_de/products/imaging-systems/lightsheet-z-1.html) is a commercial lightsheet platform developed by Zeiss AG.

The microscope is operated via the proprietary software ZEN. During data acquisition, it is possible to "stream" data, which basically means that images are saved to the hard drive (or server) as they are taken. The way data is saved can be set in the "Streaming tool window" in the "Maintain" tab. For example, different time points in a time lapse acquisition and/or different views in a multiview acquisition can be saved as different files. These settings may be important if you want to do multiview registration in Fiji or other packages.

This page concerns optical tissue clearing (that is, rendering it transparent in order to image deeper) and imaging in a setup based on OpenSPIM.

=Tissue clearing=



=Immersion media=

Generally cleared tissue has a higher refractive index than water. To prevent losing focus when moving the sample, you have to use immersion medium with the same RI as the sample.

=Objectives & chambers =

Optimally, an immersion objective matched to the tissue refractive index should be used. Such objectives exist (by Zeiss, Olympus and Leica at the time of writing), but are very expensive.

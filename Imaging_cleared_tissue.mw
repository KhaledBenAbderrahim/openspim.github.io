This page concerns optical tissue clearing (that is, rendering it transparent in order to image deeper) and imaging in a setup based on OpenSPIM.

=Tissue clearing=

There now exist a range of tissue clearing techniques for both mammalian and plant tissues. For a summary of various clearing techniques, and detailed instructions for performing CLARITY (excellent for neural tissue), please consult the following manual developed by the 3D Tissue Clearing and Lightsheet Microscopy Facility (HMRI/UoN) [[Media:3D_Tissue_Clearing_Handbook_3rd_Ed.pdf]]

=Immersion media=

Generally cleared tissue has a higher refractive index than water. To prevent losing focus when moving the sample, you have to use immersion medium with the same RI as the sample.

=Objectives & chambers =

Optimally, an immersion objective matched to the tissue refractive index should be used. Such objectives exist (by Zeiss, Olympus and Leica at the time of writing), but are very expensive. Long working distance air and water objectives can be used as well, but their performance will be somewhat limited by aberrations. Keep in mind that working distance changes if the immersion medium RI changes - this has to be taken into account when designing the setup.

=Sample mounting=

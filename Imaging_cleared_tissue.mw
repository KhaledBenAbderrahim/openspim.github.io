This page concerns optical tissue clearing (that is, rendering it transparent in order to image deeper) and imaging in a setup based on OpenSPIM.

=Tissue clearing=

There now exist a range of tissue clearing techniques for both mammalian and plant tissues. From imaging point of view, they fall into two categories:
* solvent-based methods (BABB, ...DISCO) result in refractive index in the 1.55-1.56 range. These methods usually lead to sample shrinkage. The solvents are incompatible with most objectives and materials.
* hydrogel and other aqueous methods (CLARITY, Scale, CUBIC etc. ) yield samples with refractive index 1.47-1.49. Samples often swell. Ordinary immersion objectives can be used.

=Immersion media=

Generally cleared tissue has a higher refractive index than water. To prevent losing focus when moving the sample, you have to use immersion medium with the same RI as the sample.

=Objectives & chambers =

Optimally, an immersion objective matched to the tissue refractive index should be used. Such objectives exist (by Zeiss, Olympus and Leica at the time of writing), but are very expensive. Long working distance air and water objectives can be used as well, but their performance will be somewhat limited by aberrations. Keep in mind that working distance changes if the immersion medium RI changes - this has to be taken into account when designing the setup.

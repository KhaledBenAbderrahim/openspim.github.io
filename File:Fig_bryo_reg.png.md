Visualization of multiple views of a bryozoan larva during registration steps. Each angle has a different color viewed on the BigDataViewer. A Original orientation of the multiple view stacks. In order to facilitate the content-based registration (without beads) the views need to be at the same orientation. A transformation was applied to the Y axis to place each view at the same orientation. B Multiple views after transformation. All stacks are oriented in the same manner. C Result of the registration step with the different views combined into a single fused stack.

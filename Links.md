OpenSPIM's software is based on the [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/),
[ImageJ](http://imagej.net) and
[Micro-Manager](http://micro-manager.org) projects. Micro-Manager is
backed by the [OpenImaging](https://open-imaging.com/) company.

# Other Open Access projects

These section contains links to projects which share OpenSPIM's vision
that

  - Karl Bellve's ["pretty good
    focus"](https://github.com/kbellve/pgFocus) project is an Open
    Access design for an automatic stage focusing device. It is intended
    to [integrate nicely](http://micro-manager.org/wiki/PgFocus) with
    µManager, just like OpenSPIM.

    requiring [ImageJ](http://imagej.net/) and Piotr Wendykier's

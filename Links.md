OpenSPIM's software is based on the [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/), [ImageJ](https://imagej.net) and [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org) projects. Micro-Manager is backed by the [OpenImaging](https://open-imaging.com/) company.

# Other Open Access projects

These section contains links to projects which share OpenSPIM's vision that

> We hope that OpenSPIM in its radical openness will demonstrate that

> equally well to hardware.

  - Karl Bellve's ["pretty good focus"](https://github.com/kbellve/pgFocus) project is an Open Access design for an automatic stage focusing device. It is intended to [integrate nicely](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/PgFocus) with µManager, just like OpenSPIM.

  - A [paper](https://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0059840) on 3D-printable optical components.

  - [OpenSPIN](https://sites.google.com/site/openspinmicroscopy/) a sister project for DLSM and OPT imaging.

  - [MSIM](https://code.google.com/p/msim/), a "dual view" light-sheet microscopy system, with [parts of the code written in Python](https://code.google.com/p/msim/source/browse/) (but also requiring [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/) and Piotr Wendykier's [Parallel Iterative Deconvolution plugin](https://sites.google.com/site/piotrwendykier/software/deconvolution/paralleliterativedeconvolution)) and instructions [how to build one](https://code.google.com/p/msim/wiki/Building_your_own_MSIM).

  - An [Atomic Force Microscope using Lego](https://mcise.uri.edu/park/MNEL/legoafm/index.html).

  - An [Open-Source CT Scanner](https://makezine.com/magazine/make-38-cameras-and-av/open-source-ct-scanner/)

  - [Open Ephys](https://www.open-ephys.org/), a very strong project to provide, develop and support Open Access and Open Source electrophysiology.

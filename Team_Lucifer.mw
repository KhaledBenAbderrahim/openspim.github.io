The name "lucifer" is from Latin "bearer of light".

=Early Zebrafish development=

Specification of Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) in Zebrafish has 2 modes: one through maternal cytoplasmic inheritance of ‘germ plasm’  and this is common in most invertebrates and non-mammalians. The second is through induction of pluripotent epiblast cells during gastrulation and is common to mammals. 
The common denominator in most organisms is the migration of PGCs to genital ridge, further proliferation and differentiation.

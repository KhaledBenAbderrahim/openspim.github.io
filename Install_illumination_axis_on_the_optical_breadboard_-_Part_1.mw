<b><span style="color:#FF0000"> The optical breadboard </span></b> (ThorLabs Part #: MB3045/M) <b><span style="color:#FF0000"> has a depth of 300 mm and a width of 450 mm, with a grid of 12 x 18 M6 threaded holes spaced 25 mm apart from one another. We will use a coordinate system similar to a spreadsheet (like OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel) to make it easier to know where each component and capscrew is positioned. Starting with A1 in the  upper left corner </span></b> (as seen in the images)<b><span style="color:#FF0000">, and ending with R12 in the lower right </span></b>

Please also forgive the confusion about the Youtube videos and their corresponding images below, the documentation was done in two different locations months apart from each other and small design changes happened in between.

== Install 1" mirror assembly and its spacer post ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x POLARIS-K1 1" mirror mount with mirror installed
*1x M4x50 mm capscrew
*1x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*1x 25 mm tall optical post/spacer with M4 thru tap through the center
*1x M4 nut

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver
*1x Needle nosed pliers

===== [http://youtu.be/tErFX8eFffU/ How to install the large mirror mount on the corner of the optical breadboard] =====

Put the M4x50 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the <b>bottom</b> side of the optical breadboard in a corner M6 thru tap. It is easy to differentiate between the thru tap and threaded hole, because the thru tap is off the usual grid between 4 threaded holes. The bottom side is the side where you can see 2 different diameters of thru tap, the larger one that stops half way through the optical breadboard is where the SD1 washer can rest.

<b><span style="color:#FF0000"> From here on out till the completion of the installation of the OpenSPIM the furthest threaded hole juxtaposed in the opposite corner to the 1" mirror post will be called A1. See above. </span></b>

== Install the CUBE laser heatsink ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Coherent CUBE solid state laser diode attached to a machined metal (i.e. Aluminum) laser heatsink
*4x M6x25 mm capscrews

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 5 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/zDHqsXEtSdA/ How and where to install the laser with heatsink on the optical breadboard] =====

Place the CUBE laser heatsink assembly so that the mounting capscrew holes/notches are at D8, D10, H8 & H10 on the optical breadboard respectively. Using a 5 mm hex key/driver, screw the heatsink down to the optical breadboard using M6x25 mm capscrews.

== Mount dovetail rails onto optical breadboard ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x ThorLabs part #: RLA075/M 75 mm dovetail rail
*2x ThorLabs part #: RLA150/M 150 mm dovetail rails
*1x ThorLabs part #: RLA300/M 300 mm dovetail rail
*6x (or more) M6x16 mm capscrews
 
===== Tools needed =====

*1x 5 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/kqLbBT7vgrc/ How to and where to install the dovetail rails on the optical breadboard] =====

Place one of the 150 mm dovetail rails lengthwise with its ends on B6 to B12. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 to 5 M6 capscrews along the length of the dovetail rail in holes B7 through B11. I personally put 2 M6 capscrews in B8 and B10.

Place the 300 mm dovetail rail lengthwise along row 11 between columns D and O. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 M6 capscrews in the middle of the 2 long slit holes of the dovetail rail in holes F11 and M11. You can slide the position of the dovetail rail 25 mm along its long axis.

Place the other 150 mm dovetail rail lengthwise with its ends on Q5 to Q11. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 to 5 M6 capscrews along the length of the dovetail rail in holes B6 through B10. I personally put 2 M6 capscrews in B7 and B9.

Place the 75 mm dovetail rail lengthwise with its ends on O3 to R3. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 M6 capscrews along the length of the dovetail rail in holes P3 through Q3. I personally put 2 M6 capscrews in B8 and B10.

== Install both 1/2" mirror assemblies on rail system ==

===== Objects needed =====

*2x 1/2" mirror assemblies on rail carriers
*1x Optical breadboard with dovetail rail system installed

===== Tools needed =====

*None

===== [http://youtu.be/MxL_oFhFfTc/ How and where to install the small mirror mounts on the optical breadboard] =====

Position the 1/2 mirror assemblies on their respective rail carriers on the first 150 mm dovetail rail so that the laser beam will be reflected along the whole rail system. The first 1/2" mirror assembly should face 45 degrees to the right of the front of the laser while the second should face 45 degrees to the left. See the images or Youtube video for further clarification.

Also, the rail carriers tightening knobs should always face out along the edge of the OpenSPIM system.

== Install the OpenSPIM chamber ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x OpenSPIM chamber assembly
*1x Optical breadboard with dovetail rail system installed

===== Tools needed =====

*None

===== [http://youtu.be/SC2u7zWtdE8/ How and where to install the OpenSPIM chamber on the rail system] =====

Slide the OpenSPIM chamber assembly onto the 75 mm dovetail rail along the 20x detection objective axis so that the back of the 10x illumination objective is facing the 1" mirror mount along the dovetail rail axis.

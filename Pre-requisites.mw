'''Hardware requirements'''

OpenSPIM image processing involves computationally relatively expensive steps particularly due to the size of the imaged dataset. Typical acquisition will consist of multiple views  100-400 MB each. Those large images have to be at least temporarily held in memory, usually in multiple copies and therefore we recommend to '''invest in RAM'''. 

Most of the code involved in SPIMage processing is in Java and is multi-threaded, therefore investing in '''multi-core processors''' is also advisable.

The output of the SPIMage processing may increase the already substantial total raw data volume and so it is prudent to plan for '''ample hard drive''' space.

Multi-view deconvolution, 3d rendering and in general visualisation of SPIM data is placing high demands on graphics hardware (GPU). We recommend to invest in [http://www.nvidia.de/object/cuda_home_new.html '''CUDA capable graphics cards'''] such as NVIDIA Tesla or Quadro or GeForce.

Moving SPIM amount of data to and from the computer takes time and every network bottleneck between the end points should be removed starting with '''10GigaBit Network Interface'''.

The processing described in this tutorial is performed on the following hardware configuration:

 Processor : '''Two Intel Xeon Processor E5-2630''' ('''Six Core, 2.30GHz Turbo''', 15MB, 7.2 GT/s) 
 Memory : '''128GB''' (16x8GB) 1600MHz DDR3 ECC RDIMM
 Hard Drive : '''4x2TB''' 3.5inch Serial ATA (7.200 Rpm) Hard Drive
 HDD Controller : PERC H310 SATA/SAS Controller for Dell Precision
 HDD Configuration : C1 SATA 3.5inch, 1-4 Hard Drives
 Graphics : '''Dual 2 GB NVIDIA Quadro 4000''' (2cards w/ 2DP & 1DVI-I each) (2DP-DVI & 2DVI-VGA adapter) (MRGA17H)
 Network : Intel X520-T2 Dual Port '''10GbE Network Interface Card'''

'''Hardware requirements'''

OpenSPIM image processing involves computationally relatively expensive steps particularly due to the size of the imaged dataset. Typical acquisition will consist of multiple views  100-400 MB each. Those large images have to be at least temporarily held in memory, usually in multiple copies and therefore we recommend to '''invest in RAM'''. 

Most of the code involved in SPIMage processing is in Java and is multi-threaded, therefore investing in '''multi-core processors''' is also advisable.

The output of the SPIMage processing may increase the already substantial total raw data volume and so it is prudent to plan for '''ample hard drive''' space.

Multi-view deconvolution, 3d rendering and in general visualisation of SPIM data is placing high demands on graphics hardware (GPU). We recommend to invest in [http://www.nvidia.de/object/cuda_home_new.html '''CUDA capable graphics cards'''] such as NVIDIA Tesla or Quadro or GeForce.

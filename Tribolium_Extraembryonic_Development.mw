Embryonic development of most pterygote (winged) insects includes the formation and morphogenesis of two distinct extraembryonic epithelial sheets: the serosa and the amnion (reviewed in [[#Panfilio2008 |Panfilio 2008]] and [[#SchmidtOtt_etal_2010|Schmidt-Ott et al. 2010]]). In ''Drosophila'' these tissues are secondarily reduced and have evolved into what is called the amnioserosa. Therefore, despite extensive literature on ''Drosophila'' amnioserosa development, other insect models such as the red flour beetle ''Tribolium castaneum'' need to be explored in order to further our understanding of the development and evolution of insect extraembryonic membranes.

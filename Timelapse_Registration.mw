= Timelapse Registration =

Timelapse registration is necessary because the imaged specimen may, and in most cases will, drift over a long acquistion period. In OpenSPIM this situation is typically exaggregated because a) we set-up the imaging angles quickly and approximately, relying on later re-adjustment based on imaging result (thus the first time-point are usually quite off with respect to the rest of the time lapse - see [[http://openspim.org/Raw_data|raw data]], b)....

= Timelapse Registration =

Timelapse registration is necessary because the imaged specimen may, and in most cases will, drift over a long acquistion period. In OpenSPIM this situation is typically exaggregated because 

a) we set-up the imaging angles quickly and approximately, relying on later re-adjustment based on imaging result (thus the first time-points are usually quite off with respect to the rest of the time lapse - see [[Raw_data|sample raw data]]), 

b) the motors precision is limited.

The pre-requisite for time-series registration is to perform [[Registration#Cross-road_in_SPIM_plugins|'''all individual time-point registrations''']], particularly the segmentation of the beads. 

''Note that it is possible to do time-series registration also directly, i.e. segment the beads and do time-series registration in one step, however this is not a typical workflow.''

As before we walk through the set-up of plugin input, annotate the output and look into the new registration files created.

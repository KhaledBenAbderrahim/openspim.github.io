= Timelapse Registration =

Timelapse registration is necessary because the imaged specimen may, and in most cases will, drift over a long acquistion period. In OpenSPIM this situation is typically exaggregated because 

a) we set-up the imaging angles quickly and approximately, relying on later re-adjustment based on imaging result (thus the first time-points are usually quite off with respect to the rest of the time lapse - see [[Raw_data|sample raw data]]), 

b) the motors precision is limited.

The pre-requisite for time-series registration is to perform [[Registration#Cross-road_in_SPIM_plugins|'''all individual time-point registrations''']], particularly the segmentation of the beads. 

''Note that it is possible to do time-series registration also directly, i.e. segment the beads and do time-series registration in one step, however this is not a typical workflow.''

As before we walk through the set-up of plugin input, annotate the output and look into the new registration files created.

== Input ==

{|
|-
|We start by going back to registration plugin, '''Plugins->SPIM registration->Bead-based registration''', and keep the same parameters as before in the first dialog ('''Single channel''' and '''Difference-of-Mean''').
|[[File:Spim plugin menu.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Screenshot of SPIM registration section of Fiji plugin menu]]
|[[File:Registration screen1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Screenshot of the first dialog of the bead based registration plugin]]
|-
|The main dialog is the same as the one we used in indvidual time-point registration. The top set of parameters specifying file location and format should be pre-filled. We need to only change the '''Timpoints to process''' to '''0-10'''.


Next we click the checkbox '''Load segmented beads''' which signifies that the plugin should simply look into the [[Registration#Cross-road_in_SPIM_plugins|previously established]] ''[[Registration#Output|.beads.txt]]'' files in the ''/registration'' subfolder and load them. This will happen very fast compared to re-segmenting the beads. All parameters for bead segmentation are ignored.


We need to specify the calibration as explained [[Registration#Input|before]].


We will use the '''affine''' transformation model.


The option '''Re-use per timepoint registration''' should be clicked. I am actually not sure what it does, but I assume that it will load the transformation models determined in the per time-point registration and use them as a starting point. 


Finally, we must decide how will the reference time-point be determined. Reference time-point is the time-point to which all others will be registered, see [http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/SPIM_Bead_Registration#How_timelapse_registration_works for detailed explanation]. We have three option for how to choose it:


* Manually (interactive) - for this option we will be presented with a graph summarizing the registration error for each individual time-point and we will be able to choose one by clicking on the graph (see below)
* Manually (specify) - here we simply enter the index of s reference time-point, for example in the middle of the time-series
* Automatically - the plugin will settle on a reference time-point automatically, choosing the one with the lowest registration error (average bead displacement)


We choose '''Manually (interactive)''' and continue by pressing '''OK'''.

|-
|
There is some output in the '''Log''' window which we will discuss momentarily. Then a new window pops up summarizing the registration errors of the individual time-point registrations. Wiht mouse click on the time-point which you want to choose as reference. Good options are :


* a time-point in the middle of the time-series
* a time-point with low registration error


''Note that for long time-series where the specimen changes size the registration  of time-points far away from the reference may be suboptimal. In that case we recommend splitting the time-series into several independent segments and register separately to the middle time-point of each segment. The entire time series can thne be stablized using Fiji's '''Descriptor based registration'''. The description of this complex situation goes beyond the scope of this tutorial.''


We click on time-point number '''6''' and the time-series registration commences.
| colspan= "2"|[[File:TLreg2.png|thumb|400px|right|Selection of reference time point. Click with mouse pointer on tp 6 which has lowest error]]
|}

== Run ==

The output of timelapse registration rolls by quickly throuhg the '''Log''' window. All we are doing is read text files (bead positions) and running the registration, which as we saw before, is quick. The entire output can be downloaded [[Media:TLreg log.pdf|here]].

First we load the previously segmented beads and execute the per time-point registration (this is doen solely for the purpose of getting the data for the graph of registration errors). After that the graphical overview of registration errors pops up as described above. Clicking time-point 6 triggers the next barrage of output:

The 10 views are thrown together in one pile and correspondances for all pair-wise combinations are established. See [[Registration#output|here for more detailed discussion. Most view pairs have correspondances apart from TL00_Angle1 and TL06_Angle0. Altogether we the two sets of angles across two timepoints are tied together by 1332 correspondances and the RANSAC inlier ratio is excellent - 96%.

Finally the global optimization is run and we get the transformation matrices for all 10 views involved. The Angle0 of TL06 serves as a reference frame to which all other time-points are registered. Note that all angles get new transformation matrices since they are now registered in the context of a global optimization run on 10 angles (5 reference and 5 time-point specific. 


This process is repeated for every time-point in the time series, i.e. 11 times for the sample data.

== Output ==

The output is, similarly to individual time-point registration, a series of text files in the ''/registration'' directory.

The new files end with the suffix ''.to_6'' indicating that these are time-lapse registration files to the reference time-point number 6. The content of the files is equivalent to the ''.registration'' file disussed in the [[Registration#Output|registration section]], however the matrices are different.


We will now proceed to fuse the data using this new timelapse registration and compare the output to the individual per time-point registrations.

= Fusion of timelapse data =

We have seen in the [[Fusion|'''fusion part''']] of the tutorial how it is necessary to [[Fusion#First_run|first run fusion]] on downsampled data, define the [[Fusion#Cropping|cropping]] area and then [[Fusion#Final_run|re-run]] the pipeline with full resolution data. To simplify, we will skip here the steps required for defining the cropping area. It is important to note that this has to be done again as we need to define the '''crop area relative to the new timelapse registration'''. Below we show how to run the fusion on the timelapse registered data at full resolution across all time-points.

|In the main dialog the important thing to remember is to choose the correct registration file. In the first pull down menu '''Registration for channel 0''' select '''Time-point registration (reference=6) of channel 0'''. The remaining parameters remain the same (for details see [[Fusion#Input|'''fusion''']]).

Lets now examine how the time-lapse registration changed the output. As we saw in the [[Raw_data|'''raw data''']] the first angle of the first time point was way off the field of view. If we do not apply the timelapse registration the first time-point will be registered but shifted with respect to the rest of the time-lapse (see picture top row). After the timelapse registration the embryos are well aligned across time-points (bottom row). 

We have now '''FINISHED''' with the SPIMage processing pipeline. We registered all time points across space and time and we fused them all at full resolution. The results are in ''/registration'' and ''/output'' directories. In the next section of this tutorial we will learn how to [[Browsing|'''browse''']] the raw, registered and fused data in various ways.

## Materials

##### Objects needed

  - 1x Test grid/mirror sample (described below)

##### Tools needed

  - 1x Pencil with eraser.

##### How to make the test grid

To calibrate the light-sheet, a broken-up test slide such as

  - [Edmund Optics Opal Glass Ronchi Ruling
    Slide](http://www.edmundoptics.com/testing-targets/test-targets/resolution-test-targets/opal-glass-ronchi-ruling-slides/2838)
  - [Edmund Optics Multi-Grid Standard Stage
    Micrometer](http://www.edmundoptics.com/testing-targets/test-targets/image-analysis-test-targets/multi-grid-standard-stage-micrometer/58-607)

can be used. Typically, you would glue it to a sample holder (for which
we use a Braun Omnifix-F 1 ml syringe):

This assures that the laser is roughly entering in the middle of the back aperture of the 10x/0.3 NA water dipping illumination objective lens. One can see the effects on the light sheet position very easily by observing how the light exits the front of the objective lens into the water. Try and get it to come out parallel to the illumination axis, and perpendicular to the detection axis.                                                |

After it is in focus and known to be roughly flat across the field of view, rotate it 45 degrees toward the illumination objective. Finally position the sample and focus on a feature on the patterned grid/mirror. This 45 degree orientation makes it possible to bounce the laser coming out of the illumination objective directly into the detection objective. |

== Install mirrors into corresponding mirror mounts ==

==== Ø1/2" mirrors into Ø1/2" mounts ====

===== Objects needed =====

*2x ThorLabs part #: BB05-E02 Ø1/2" mirrors  <b><i>go into</i></b>
*2x ThorLabs part #: Polaris-K05 Ø1/2" mirror mounts

===== Tools needed =====

*1.5 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/TLWfcGkF-Rw/ How to install the mirrors into their respective mirror mounts] =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes and put the mirror inside the mount with its reflective side out (on the opposite side of the steering screws), and lock it snugly in place with a 1.5 mm hex key/driver.

==== Ø1" mirror into Ø1" mirror mount ====

===== Objects needed =====

*1x ThorLabs part #: BB1-E02 Ø1" mirror  <b><i>goes into</i></b>
*1x ThorLabs part #: Polaris-K1 Ø1" mirror mount

===== Tools needed =====

*2 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/TLWfcGkF-Rw/ How to install the mirrors into their respective mirror mounts] =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes and put the mirror inside the mount with its reflective side out (on the opposite side of the steering screws), and lock it snugly in place with a 2 mm hex key/driver.

== Install lenses into corresponding fixed optical mounts ==

==== Ø1/2" spherical lenses into Ø1/2" lens mounts ====

===== Objects needed =====

*2x ThorLabs part #: AC127-025-A-ML Ø1/2" SM05-Mounted <i>f</i> = 25 mm achromatic spherical lens doublet <b><i>and</i></b>
*2x ThorLabs part #: AC127-050-A-ML Ø1/2" SM05-Mounted <i>f</i> = 50 mm achromatic spherical lens doublet <b><i>thread into</i></b>
*4x ThorLabs part #: LMR05/M Ø1/2" lens mounts

===== Tools needed =====

*none

===== [http://youtu.be/fDWx4pH6a58/ How to install the spherical lenses into their optical mounts] =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes and screw the lens' external threading into the lens mount's internal threading.

==== Ø1/2" alignment tool into Ø1/2" lens mount ====

===== Objects needed =====

*1x ThorLabs part #: DG05-1500-H1-MD Ø1/2" SM05-Mounted Frosted Glass Alignment Disk with Ø1 mm Hole  <b><i>threads into</i></b>
*2x ThorLabs part #: LMR05/M Ø1/2" lens mount

===== Tools needed =====

*none

===== Directions =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes and screw the lens' external threading into the lens mount's internal threading. Same as last step, watch the last Youtube video to get a good idea how to do it.

==== Ø1" cylindrical lens into indexed rotating mount ====

===== Objects needed =====

*1x ThorLabs part #: ACY254-50-A Ø1" <i>f</i> = 50 mm achromatic cylindrical lens doublet<br />
*1x ThorLabs part #: RSP1X15/M Ø1" indexed rotating mount

===== Tools needed =====

*1x ThorLabs part #: SPW602 Ø1" threaded optics holder remover
*1x 1.3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/AEd4HmlCHVw/ How to assemble the cylindrical lens system] =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes, and after taking the Ø1" external threaded ring out, put the lens inside the mount with its arrow on the banding pointing in the direction of the light path. Use the SPW602 to put the ring back into the threading and tighten until the lens does not move. 

Align the rotation using a 1.3 mm hex key/driver by loosening the two screws on the front face of the rotational mount and rotate the face plate (not the mount) until it is in the correct position relative to the orientation of the cylindrical lens. Tighten the two front face screws down one the desired position is reached.

== Screw iris into corresponding fixed optical mount ==

==== Ø1" iris into Ø1" fixed optical mount ====

===== Objects needed =====

*1x ThorLabs part #: SM1D12D  Ø1" Ring-Activated SM1 Iris Diaphragm <b><i>threads into</i></b>
*1x ThorLabs part #: LMR1/M  Ø1" holding mount

===== Tools needed =====

none

===== [http://youtu.be/7GvfFznetsA/ How to install the iris into its optical mount] =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes, and after screwing the Ø1" external threaded ring in, screw the iris diaphragm inside the mount all the way back until it is flush with the mount.

== Mount the laser on the laser heat sink ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Coherent CUBE solid state laser diode
*1x Machined metal (i.e. Aluminum) laser heatsink (that will raise the laser beam output to 50 mm off the surface of the optical breadboard)
*4x M4 capscrews that came with the CUBE laser with their included washers.
*1x Heat transfer paste

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

<b>Wear latex or nitril gloves</b> that comfortably fit your hands! Apply heat transfer paste to the surface of the metal heat sink block where the CUBE laser will sit (everywhere between the four M4 threaded holes). Put the M4 capscrews that came with the CUBE laser through their included washers and the top of the holes in the base plate of the CUBE laser into the heatsink. using a 3 mm hex key/driver, screw the CUBE laser down onto the surface of the heatsink where the heat transfer paste is applied. Remove excess heat transfer paste with gloves on your hands!

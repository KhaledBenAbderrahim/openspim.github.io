*1x ThorLabs part #: [http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=RSP1X15/M RSP1X15/M] Ø1" indexed rotating mount

===== Tools needed =====

*1x SM1 Spanner Wrench (ThorLabs part #: [http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=SPW602 SPW602] or [http://www.thorlabs.de/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=SPW606 SPW606] will work well)

*1x 1.3 mm hex key/driver

===== How to assemble the cylindrical lens system =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes, and after taking the Ø1" external threaded ring out, put the lens inside the mount with its arrow on the banding pointing in the direction of the light path. Use the SM1 Spanner Wrench to put the ring back into the threading and tighten until the lens does not move. 

Align the rotation using a 1.3 mm hex key/driver by loosening the two screws on the front face of the rotational mount and rotate the face plate (not the mount) until it is in the correct position relative to the orientation of the cylindrical lens. Tighten the two front face screws down one the desired position is reached.

== Assembly of OpenSPIM Chamber ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Olympus [http://microscope.olympus-global.com/uis2/en/umplfln10xw/ UMPLFLN 10XW]10x/0.3 water dipping objective

*2x Machined [[:File:OpenSPIM SPIM-Chamber Objective-Ring.PDF|objective holder rings]] with 0.8"/RMS inside threading (32 tpi) and 40 mm outside diameter
*6x M3 x 8 mm capscrews
*2x NBR 70 20x3mm O-rings
*1x Machined or 3D printed [[:File:OpenSPIM_SPIM-Chamber.PDF|sample chamber]]/[[:File:OpenSPIM_SPIM-Chamber_Holder.PDF|chamber holder]]
*2x M6 x 8 mm capscrews
*1x Machined or 3D printed sample chamber

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 2.5 or 3 mm hex key/driver
*1x 5 mm hex key/driver

===== How to assemble the OpenSPIM chamber =====

Put both O-rings into their places in the sample chamber where the objectives will go. Attach the acrylic sample chamber to the metallic chamber base using the two large M6 capscrews so that the round wholes in each piece face each other. Next screw the illumination and detection objective into the machined objective holder rings. Now orient the chamber so that the acrylic face of the chamber without the opening is facing you and the openings are to your left and away from you. Push the 10x/0.3 illumination objective though the metal and the O-ring-equipped acrylic holes. It may require considerable force, it is recommended to moisten the O-rings beforehand. Rotate the objective so that the three objective holder base threaded holes are aligned with the holes in the metallic chamber base and the flat part of the objective ring is flush with the top of the chamber base. Use three M3 x 8 mm screws to attach the objective to the chamber base as tightly as possible. Repeat the same procedure for the 20x/0.5 detection objective.

== Assembly of the motor system ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x USB-4D-Stage from Picard-Industries
**1x supplied 4D system sample arm
**5x M3 x 6 mm capscrews
*1x [http://de.rs-online.com/web/p/kugellager/4090057/ NSK 6001Z]
*1x sample pully
*1x motor pully

===== Tools needed =====

===== How to assemble the OpenSPIM 4D positioning system =====

Install the ball bearing system into the end of the sample arm where the hole is drilled, make the hole just a few 10's of microns smaller than the outside diameter of the ball bearing system and that it is flush with the bottom face of the sample arm.

Then attach the arm to the system by aligning the holes on the arm that will fit the capscrew heads into them with the M3 threaded holes in the plate attached to the Y motor. 

Attach the motor pulley to the motor by tightening it down with a M2.5 set screw to the motor shaft, and drop the sample pulley into the 12 mm ball bearing hole on the sample arm. Finally use a rubber band or large diameter small gauge o-ring to go around both pulleys.

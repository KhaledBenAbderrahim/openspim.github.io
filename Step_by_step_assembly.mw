Before you start to assemble please make sure you have all [[table of parts|needed parts]] or you know how to improvise them. The light path of our original design is 50 mm off the top of the metric optical breadboard where everything is installed.

=== Lenses into corresponding fixed optical mounts ===

==== 1/2" diameter spherical lenses into 1/2" lens mounts ====

===== Objects needed =====

*2x ThorLabs part #: AC127-025-A-ML 1/2" diameter <i>f</i>=25 mm achromatic spherical lens doublet <b><i>threads into</i></b>

*2x ThorLabs part #: LMR05/M 1/2" diameter lens mounts

===== Tools needed =====

*none

===== [http://youtu.be/fDWx4pH6a58/ Directions] =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes and screw the lens' external threading into the lens mount's internal threading.

==== 1" diameter cylindrical lens into rotating mount ====

===== Objects needed =====

*1x ThorLabs part #: ACY254-50-A 1" diameter <i>f</i>=50 mm achromatic cylindrical lens doublet<br />
*1x ThorLabs part #: RSP1X15/M 1" diameter indexed rotating holding mount

===== Tools needed =====

*1x ThorLabs part #: SPW602 1" threaded optics holder remover
*1x 1.3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/AEd4HmlCHVw/ Directions] =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes, and after taking the 1" diameter external threaded ring out, put the lens inside the mount with its arrow on the banding pointing in the direction of the light path. Use the SPW602 to put the ring back into the threading and tighten until the lens does not move. 

Align the rotation using a 1.3 mm hex key/driver by loosening the two screws on the front face of the rotational mount and rotate the face plate (not the mount) until it is in the correct position relative to the orientation of the cylindrical lens. Tighten the two front face screws down one the desired position is reached.

===== Directions =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes, and after screwing the 1" diameter external threaded ring in, screw the iris diaphragm inside the mount all the way back until it is flush with the mount.

== Put assembled components on rail carriers ==

==== 1/2" mirror mount assemblies ====

===== Objects needed =====

*2x 1/2" mirror mounts with installed mirrors
*2x 19 mm stilts with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body
*2x M4x40 mm capscrews
*2x M4 nuts
*2x ThorLabs part #: SD1 M4 to M6 adapter
*2x ThorLabs part #: RC1 rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x needle nosed pliers
*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Put the M4x40 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 19 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 15-20 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. Set the base of the mirror on the stilt through one of its holes, and screw a M4 nut over the remaing threading of the M4 capscrew. Grab and hold the M4 nut with the needle nosed pliers and from the bottom of the RC1 rail carrier use the 3 mm hex key/driverto screw the capscrew tight. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the mirror mount on this assembly when laser alignment will take place.

==== 1/2" spherical lens mount assemblies ====

===== Objects needed =====

*4x 1/2" lens mounts with installed spherical achromatic doublet lenses
*4x 15 mm stilts with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body (either self made or ThorLabs part #: SC1 - spacer)
*4x M4x25 mm capscrews
*4x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*4x ThorLabs part #: RC1 - rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Put the M4x25 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 15 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 5 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the lens mount is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the mirror mount on this assembly when laser alignment will take place.

== Install mirror mount post ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x M4x20 mm capscrew
*1x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*1x 1" tall optical post with M4 threading through the center
*1x ThorLabs part#: MB3045/M - 300x450x12.7 mm optical breadboard

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Put the M4x20 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the optical breadboard in the hole in the corner that is tapped through with no threading (which we will call QR,11-12). It is easy to see which the correct side is by the diameter size of this corner hole, the larger side is the bottom.

== Install the POLARIS-K1 mirror mount on post ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x M4x15 mm capscrew
*1x POLARIS-K1 1" mirror mount with mirror installed

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Using a 3 mm hex key/driver, put the M4x15 mm capscrew through the M4 thru tapped mounting hole in the POLARIS-K1 mirror mount, and screw into theM4 threaded 1" tall post.

== Install the Laser  ==


=== Mount the laser on the laser heat sink ===

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Coherent CUBE solid state laser diode
*1x Machined metal (i.e. Aluminum) laser heatsink (that will raise the laser beam output to 50 mm off the surface of the optical breadboard)
*4x M4 capscrews that came with the CUBE laser with their included washers.
*1x Heat transfer paste

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Wear latex or nitril gloves that comfortably fit your hands! Apply heat transfer paste to the surface of the metal heat sink block where the CUBE laser will sit (everywhere between the four M4 threaded holes). Put the M4 capscrews that came with the CUBE laser through their included washers and the top of the holes in the base plate of the CUBE laser into the heatsink. using a 3 mm hex key/driver, screw the CUBE laser down onto the surface of the heatsink where the heat transfer paste is applied. Remove excess heat transfer paste with gloves on your hands! 


=== Mount the laser on the bread board ===

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Coherent CUBE solid state laser diode attached to a machined metal (i.e. Aluminum) laser heatsink
*4x M6x25 mm capscrews

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 5 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Place the CUBE laser heatsink assembly so that the mounting capscrew holes/notches are at D8, D10, H8 & H10 on the optical breadboard respectively. Using a 5 mm hex key/driver, screw the heatsink down to the optical breadboard using M6x25 mm capscrews.

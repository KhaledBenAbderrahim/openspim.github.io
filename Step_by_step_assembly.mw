Before you start to assemble please make sure you have all [[table of parts|needed parts]] or you know how to improvise them. The light path of our original design is 50 mm off the top surface of the ThorLabs metric optical breadboard (part #: MB3045/M) where everything is installed.

<b><span style="color:#FF0000"> The optical breadboard has a depth of 300 mm and a width of 450 mm, with a grid of 12 x 18 M6 threaded holes spaced 25 mm apart from one another. We will use a coordinate system similar to a spreadsheet </span></b>(like OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel)<b><span style="color:#FF0000"> to make it easier to know where each component and capscrew is positioned. Starting with A1 in the upper left corner </span></b>(as seen in the images)<b><span style="color:#FF0000">, and ending with R12 in the lower right.</span></b>

Please also forgive the confusion about the Youtube videos and the corresponding images, the documentation was done in two different locations months apart from each other and small design changes happened in between.

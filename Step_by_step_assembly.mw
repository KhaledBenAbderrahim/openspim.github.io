Before you start to assemble please make sure you have all [[table of parts|needed parts]] or you know how to improvise them. The light path of our original design is 50 mm off the top surface of the ThorLabs metric optical breadboard (part #: MB3045/M) where everything is installed.

===== [http://youtu.be/N_S5flUvKIE/ Directions] =====

Put the M4x40 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 19 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 15-20 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. Set the base of the mirror on the stilt through one of its holes, and screw a M4 nut over the remaining threading of the M4 capscrew. Grab and hold the M4 nut with the needle nosed pliers and from the bottom of the RC1 rail carrier use the 3 mm hex key/driver to screw the capscrew tight. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of these assemblies when aligning the laser.

==== Ø1/2" spherical lens mount assemblies ====

===== Objects needed =====

*5x Ø1/2" optical mounts with installed optical components (2x <b>f</b> = 25 mm achromat, 2x <b>f</b> = 50 mm achromat & 1x 1 mm alignment tool)

Put the M4x25 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 15 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 5 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the lens mount is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of these assemblies when aligning the laser.

==== Vertical slit mechanism ====

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Vertical slit mechanism
*1x 13 mm stilt with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body 
*1x M4x20 mm capscrew
*1x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*1x ThorLabs part #: RC1 - rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/pgHzF4xwUTU/ Directions] =====

Put the M4x22 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 13 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 2 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the vertical slit mechanism is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of this assembly when aligning the laser.

==== Iris assembly ====

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Iris mechanism
*1x 10 mm stilt with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body 
*1x M4x20 mm capscrew

*1x ThorLabs part #: RC1 - rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/r3XgT8I1RIU/ Directions] =====

Put the M4x22 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 2-3 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 2-3 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the Ø1" optical mount, where the iris mechanism resides, is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of this assembly when aligning the laser.

== Install illumination axis on the optical breadboard ==
<b><span style="color:#FF0000"> The optical breadboard </span></b> (ThorLabs Part #: MB3045/M) <b><span style="color:#FF0000"> has a depth of 300 mm and a width of 450 mm, with a grid of 12 x 18 M6 threaded holes spaced 25 mm apart from one another. We will use a coordinate system similar to a spreadsheet to make it easier to know where each component and capscrew is positioned. Starting with A1 in the upper left corner, and ending with R12 in the lower right </span></b>

Please also forgive the confusion about the Youtube videos and their corresponding images below, the documentation was done in two different locations months apart from each other and small design changes happened in between.

=== Install 1" mirror assembly and its spacer post ===

===== Objects needed =====

*1x POLARIS-K1 1" mirror mount with mirror installed
*1x M4x50 mm capscrew
*1x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*1x 25 mm tall optical post/spacer with M4 thru tap through the center
*1x M4 nut

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver
*1x Needle nosed pliers

===== [http://youtu.be/tErFX8eFffU/ Directions] =====

Put the M4x50 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the <b>bottom</b> side of the optical breadboard in a corner M6 thru tap. It is easy to differentiate between the thru tap and threaded hole, because the thru tap is off the usual grid between 4 threaded holes. The bottom side is the side where you can see 2 different diameters of thru tap, the larger one that stops half way through the optical breadboard is where the SD1 washer can rest.

<b><span style="color:#FF0000"> From here on out till the completion of the installation of the OpenSPIM the furthest threaded hole juxtaposed in the opposite corner to the 1" mirror post will be called A1. See above. </span></b>

===== [http://youtu.be/kqLbBT7vgrc/ Directions] =====

Place one of the 150 mm dovetail rails lengthwise with its ends on B6 to B12. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 to 5 M6 capscrews along the length of the dovetail rail in holes B7 through B11. I personally put 2 M6 capscrews in B8 and B10.

Place the 300 mm dovetail rail lengthwise along row 11 between columns D and O. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 M6 capscrews in the middle of the 2 long slit holes of the dovetail rail in holes F11 and M11. You can slide the position of the dovetail rail 25 mm along its long axis.

Place the other 150 mm dovetail rail lengthwise with its ends on Q5 to Q11. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 to 5 M6 capscrews along the length of the dovetail rail in holes B6 through B10. I personally put 2 M6 capscrews in B7 and B9.

Place the 75 mm dovetail rail lengthwise with its ends on O3 to R3. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 M6 capscrews along the length of the dovetail rail in holes P3 through Q3. I personally put 2 M6 capscrews in B8 and B10.

=== Install both 1/2" mirror assemblies on rail system ===

===== Objects needed =====

*2x 1/2" mirror assemblies on rail carriers
*1x Optical breadboard with dovetail rail system installed

===== Tools needed =====

*None

===== [http://youtu.be/MxL_oFhFfTc/ Directions] =====

Position the 1/2 mirror assemblies on their respective rail carriers on the first 150 mm dovetail rail so that the laser beam will be reflected along the whole rail system. The first 1/2" mirror assembly should face 45 degrees to the right of the front of the laser while the second should face 45 degrees to the left. See the images or Youtube video for further clarification.

Also, the rail carriers tightening knobs should always face out along the edge of the OpenSPIM system.

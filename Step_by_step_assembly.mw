Before you start to assemble please make sure you have all [[table of parts|needed parts]] or you know how to improvise them. The light path of our original design is 50 mm off the top surface of the ThorLabs metric optical breadboard (part #: MB3045/M) where everything is installed.

Use the SPW602 to put the ring back into the threading and tighten until the lens does not move. 

Align the rotation using a 1.3 mm hex key/driver by loosening the two screws on the front face of the rotational mount and rotate the face plate (not the mount) until it is in the correct position relative to the orientation of the cylindrical lens. Tighten the two front face screws down one the desired position is reached.

Put the M4 capscrews that came with the CUBE laser through their included washers and the top of the holes in the base plate of the CUBE laser into the heatsink. using a 3 mm hex key/driver, screw the CUBE laser down onto the surface of the heatsink where the heat transfer paste is applied. Remove excess heat transfer paste with gloves on your hands!

== Put assembled ThorLabs components on rail carriers ==

==== 1/2" mirror mount assemblies ====

===== Objects needed =====

*2x 19 mm stilts with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body
*2x M4x40 mm capscrews
*2x M4 nuts
*2x ThorLabs part #: SD1 M4 to M6 adapter
*2x ThorLabs part #: RC1 rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x needle nosed pliers
*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/N_S5flUvKIE/ Directions] =====

Put the M4x40 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 19 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 15-20 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. Set the base of the mirror on the stilt through one of its holes, and screw a M4 nut over the remaining threading of the M4 capscrew. Grab and hold the M4 nut with the needle nosed pliers and from the bottom of the RC1 rail carrier use the 3 mm hex key/driver to screw the capscrew tight. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of these assemblies when aligning the laser.

==== 1/2" spherical lens mount assemblies ====

===== Objects needed =====

*4x 1/2" lens mounts with installed spherical achromatic doublet lenses
*4x 15 mm stilts with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body (either self made or ThorLabs part #: SC1 - spacer)

*4x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*4x ThorLabs part #: RC1 - rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/N_S5flUvKIE/ Directions] =====

Put the M4x25 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 15 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 5 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the lens mount is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of these assemblies when aligning the laser.

==== Vertical slit mechanism ====

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Vertical slit mechanism
*1x 13 mm stilt with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body 
*1x M4x20 mm capscrew
*1x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*1x ThorLabs part #: RC1 - rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/pgHzF4xwUTU/ Directions] =====

Put the M4x22 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 13 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 2 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the vertical slit mechanism is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of this assembly when aligning the laser.

==== Iris assembly ====

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Iris mechanism
*1x 10 mm stilt with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body 
*1x M4x10 mm capscrew
*1x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*1x ThorLabs part #: RC1 - rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/r3XgT8I1RIU/ Directions] =====

Put the M4x22 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The <b><i>??</i></b> mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about <b><i>??</i></b> mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the 1" optical mount, where the iris mechanism resides, is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the position of this assembly when aligning the laser.

== Install everything on to the optical breadboard ==
<b><span style="color:#FF0000"> The optical breadboard </span></b> (ThorLabs Part #: MB3045/M) <b><span style="color:#FF0000"> has a depth of 300 mm and a width of 450 mm, with a grid of 12 x 18 M6 threaded holes spaced 25 mm apart from one another. We will use a coordinate system similar to a spreadsheet to make it easier to know where each component and capscrew is positioned. Starting with A1 in the upper left corner, and ending with R12 in the lower right </span></b>

Please also forgive the confusion about movies and their corresponding images below, the documentation was done in two different locations months apart from each other and small design changes have happen in between them.

=== Install 1" mirror assembly and its spacer post ===

===== Objects needed =====

*1x POLARIS-K1 1" mirror mount with mirror installed
*1x M4x50 mm capscrew
*1x ThorLabs part #: SD1 -  M4 to M6 adapter
*1x 25 mm tall optical post/spacer with M4 thru tap through the center
*1x M4 nut

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver
*1x Needle nosed pliers

===== [http://youtu.be/tErFX8eFffU/ Directions] =====

Put the M4x50 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the <b>bottom</b> side of the optical breadboard in a corner M6 thru tap. It is easy to differentiate between the thru tap and threaded hole, because the thru tap is off the usual grid between 4 threaded holes. The bottom side is the side where you can see 2 different diameters of thru tap, the larger one that stops half way through the optical breadboard is where the SD1 washer can rest.

<b><span style="color:#FF0000"> From here on out till the completion of the installation of the OpenSPIM the furthest threaded hole juxtaposed in the opposite corner to the 1" mirror post will be called A1. See above. </span></b>

=== Install the CUBE laser heatsink ===

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Coherent CUBE solid state laser diode attached to a machined metal (i.e. Aluminum) laser heatsink
*4x M6x25 mm capscrews

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 5 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/zDHqsXEtSdA/ Directions] =====

Place the CUBE laser heatsink assembly so that the mounting capscrew holes/notches are at D8, D10, H8 & H10 on the optical breadboard respectively. Using a 5 mm hex key/driver, screw the heatsink down to the optical breadboard using M6x25 mm capscrews.

*6x (or more) M6x16 mm capscrews
 
===== Tools needed =====

*1x 5 mm hex key/driver

===== [http://youtu.be/zDHqsXEtSdA/ Directions] =====

Place one of the 150 mm dovetail rails lengthwise with its ends on B6 to B12. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 to 5 M6 capscrews along the length of the dovetail rail in holes B7 through B11. I personally put 2 M6 capscrews in B8 and B10.

Place the 300 mm dovetail rail lengthwise along row 11 between columns D and O. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 M6 capscrews in the middle of the 2 long slit holes of the dovetail rail in holes F11 and M11. You can slide the position of the dovetail rail 25 mm along its long axis.

Place the other 150 mm dovetail rail lengthwise with its ends on Q5 to Q11. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 to 5 M6 capscrews along the length of the dovetail rail in holes B6 through B10. I personally put 2 M6 capscrews in B7 and B9.

Place the 75 mm dovetail rail lengthwise with its ends on O3 to R3. Using the 5 mm hex key/driver, screw in 2 M6 capscrews along the length of the dovetail rail in holes P3 through Q3. I personally put 2 M6 capscrews in B8 and B10.

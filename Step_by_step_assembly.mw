Before you start to assemble please make sure you have all [[table of parts|needed parts]] or you know how to improvise them. The light path of our original design is 50 mm off the top surface of the ThorLabs metric optical breadboard (part #: MB3045/M) where everything is installed.
== Alignment of laser ==

===== Objects needed =====

*1x Installed Coherent CUBE laser with heatsink
*2x Installed 1\2" mirror mount assemblies on the dovetail rail
*1x Installed 1" mirror mount on corner post
*1x ThorLabs part #: <b>DG05-1500-H1-MD - Ø1/2" SM05-Mounted Frosted Glass Alignment Disk w/Ø1 mm Hole </b>

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 1.5 mm hex key/driver
*Nx Just a little [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYzraMwM8n0 patience]

===== [http://youtu.be/wpbCUX2KXG4 How to do a laser alignment of the OpenSPIM's illumination axis] =====

Take off all jewelry (wedding bands, watches and anything shiny)! Power on laser. Roughly rotate, and adjust the distances to, all of the installed mirror mounts so that the laser will reflect off of the middle of the mirror surface of each assembly into the back of the illumination objective.

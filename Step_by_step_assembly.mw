Before you start to assemble please make sure you have all [[table of parts|needed parts]] or you know how to improvise them. The light path of our original design is 50 mm off the top of the metric optical breadboard where everything is installed.

== Put all components together ==

=== Mirrors into corresponding mirror mounts ===

==== 1/2" diameter mirrors into 1/2" diameter mounts ====

*2x ThorLabs part #: BB05-E02 1/2" diameter mirrors  <b><i>go into</i></b>
*2x ThorLabs part #: Polaris-K05 1/2" diameter mirror mounts

===== Tools needed =====

*1.5 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes and put the mirror inside the mount with its reflective side out (on the opposite side of the steering screws), and lock it snugly in place with a 1.5 mm hex key/driver.

==== 1" diameter mirror into 1" diameter mirror mount ====

*1x ThorLabs part #: BB1-E02 1" diameter mirror  <b><i>goes into</i></b>
*1x ThorLabs part #: Polaris-K1 1" diameter mirror mount

===== Tools needed =====

*2 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes and put the mirror inside the mount with its reflective side out (on the opposite side of the steering screws), and lock it snugly in place with a 2 mm hex key/driver.

=== Lenses into corresponding fixed optical mounts ===

==== 1/2" diameter spherical lenses into 1/2" lens mounts ====

*2x ThorLabs part #: AC127-025-A-ML 1/2" diameter 25 mm focal length achromatic spherical lens doublet <b><i>threads into</i></b>
*2x ThorLabs part #: LMR05/M 1/2" diameter lens mounts

*2x ThorLabs part #: AC127-050-A-ML 1/2" diameter 50 mm focal length achromatic spherical lens doublet <b><i>threads into</i></b>
*2x ThorLabs part #: LMR05/M 1/2" diameter lens mounts

===== Tools needed =====

*none

===== Directions =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes and screw the lens' external threading into the lens mount's internal threading.

==== 1" diameter cylindrical lens into rotating mount ====

*1x ThorLabs part #: ACY254-50-A 1" diameter 50 mm focal length achromatic cylindrical lens doublet<br />
*1x ThorLabs part #: RSP1X15/M 1" diameter indexed rotating holding mount

===== Tools needed =====

*1x ThorLabs part #: SPW602 1" threaded optics holder remover
*1x 1.3 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes, and after taking the 1" diameter external threaded ring out, put the lens inside the mount with its arrow on the banding pointing in the direction of the light path. Use the SPW602 to put the ring back into the threading and tighten until the lens does not move. Using a 1.3 mm hex key/driver, loosen the two screws on the front face of the rotational mount and rotate the face plate (not the mount) until it is in the correct position relative to the orientation of the cylindrical lens. Tighten the two front face screws down one the desired position is reached.

=== Iris into corresponding fixed optical mount ===

==== 1" diameter iris into 1" diameter fixed optical mount ====

*1x ThorLabs part #: SM1D12D  1" diameter Ring-Activated SM1 Iris Diaphragm <b><i>threads into</i></b>
*1x ThorLabs part #: LMR1/M  1" diameter indexed rotating holding mount

===== Tools needed =====

none

===== Directions =====

Take both components out of their respective boxes, and after srcewing the 1" diameter external threaded ring in, screw the iris diaphragm inside the mount all the way back until it is flush with the mount.

== Put assembled components on rail carriers ==

==== 1/2" mirror mount assemblies ====

*2x 1/2" mirror mounts with installed mirrors
*2x 19 mm stilts with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body
*2x M4x40 mm capscrews
*2x M4 nuts
*2x ThorLabs part #: SD1 M4 to M6 adapter
*2x ThorLabs part #: RC1 rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x needle nosed pliers
*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Put the M4x40 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 19 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 15-20 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. Set the base of the mirror on the stilt through one of its holes, and screw a M4 nut over the remaing threading of the M4 capscrew. Grab and hold the M4 nut with the needle nosed pliers and from the bottom of the RC1 rail carrier use the 3 mm hex key/driverto screw the capscrew tight. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the mirror mount on this assembly when laser alignment will take place.

==== 1/2" spherical lens mount assemblies ====

*4x 1/2" lens mounts with installed spherical achromatic doublet lenses
*4x 15 mm stilts with a M4 thru hole through the middle of it's body
*4x M4x25 mm capscrews
*4x ThorLabs part #: SD1 M4 to M6 adapter
*4x ThorLabs part #: RC1 rail carrier

===== Tools needed =====

*1x 3 mm hex key/driver

===== Directions =====

Put the M4x25 mm capscrew through a SD1 M4 to M6 adapter, then the capscrew/adapter assembly through the bottom side of the RC1 rail carrier. The 15 mm stilt then goes over and through the M4 thru hole, so that there is about 5 mm of threading of the M4 capscrew poking out. On the bottom/base of the lens mount is a threaded hole for M4 capscrew, rotate the mount around until it is snug then give it a 1/4 turn to tighten it with the 3 mm hex key/driver. Further angular adjustments will need to be made to the mirror mount on this assembly when laser alignment will take place.

In order to build an OpenSPIM it is important to understand the optics principles behind its function and the role of the various components. '''Jan Krieger''' started assembling an excellent set of pages that do just that.

The pages can be found under [[SPIM Optics 101|'''SPIM Optics 101''']]

# '''[[SPIM Optics 101/Theoretical basics]]''': Introduces basics of optics (geometric optic, gaussian beams, ...)
# '''[[SPIM Optics 101/Practical Hints]]''': gives general hints and tips, when setting up optics.
# '''[[Laser Safety]]'''

Similar pages can be grouped using the '''SPIM Optics 101''' Category.

Thanks to Jan for starting this in the true spirit of the OpenSPIM platform.

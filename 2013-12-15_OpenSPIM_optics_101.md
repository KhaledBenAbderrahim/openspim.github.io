In order to build an OpenSPIM it is important to understand the optics
principles behind its function and the role of the various components.
**Jan Krieger** started assembling an excellent set of pages that do
just that.

The pages can be found under [**SPIM Optics
101**](SPIM_Optics_101 "wikilink")

1.  **[SPIM Optics 101/Theoretical
    basics](SPIM_Optics_101/Theoretical_basics "wikilink")**: Introduces
    basics of optics (geometric optic, gaussian beams, ...)
2.  **[SPIM Optics 101/Practical
    Hints](SPIM_Optics_101/Practical_Hints "wikilink")**: gives general
    hints and tips, when setting up optics.
3.  **[Laser Safety](Laser_Safety "wikilink")**

Similar pages can be grouped using the **SPIM Optics 101** Category.

Thanks to Jan for starting this in the true spirit of the OpenSPIM
platform.

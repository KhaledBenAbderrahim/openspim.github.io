# Launch Fiji using ''OpenSPIM.app/ImageJ-win32.exe''.
# Once Fiji has started, you can open µManager Studio from ''Plugins>Micro-Manager>Micro-Manager Studio'' (You can have it start [[FAQ#How_do_I_autostart_.C2.B5Manager_when_Fiji_starts.3F|automatically]].)
## If this is the first time you've launched µManager, you will have to [[Downloads#Initial_hardware_configuration|configure the hardware]] to continue.
# From µManager, click ''Plugins>Acquire SPIM image'' to launch the OpenSPIM plugin (You can have the OpenSPIM plugin start [[FAQ#How_do_I_autostart_the_OpenSPIM_plugin_when_.C2.B5Manager_starts_up.3F|automatically]], too).
## The Live Window will open automatically if it is not already open.

*1x Installed Coherent CUBE laser with heatsink
*2x Installed 1\2" mirror mount assemblies on the dovetail rail
*1x Installed 1" mirror mount on corner post
*1x ThorLabs part #: <b>DG05-1500-H1-MD - Ø1/2" SM05-Mounted Frosted Glass Alignment Disk w/Ø1 mm Hole </b>

===== [http://youtu.be/wpbCUX2KXG4 How to do a laser alignment of the OpenSPIM's illumination axis] =====

Take off all jewelry (wedding bands, watches and anything shiny)! Power on laser. Roughly rotate, and adjust the distances to, all of the installed mirror mounts so that the laser will reflect off of the middle of the mirror surface of each assembly into the back of the illumination objective.
